Omnes! let others ignore what they may;\nI make the poem of evil also—I commemorate that part also;\nI am myself just as much evil as good, and my nation is—And I say there is\n  in fact no evil;\n(Or if there is, I say it is just as important to you, to the land, or to me, as\n  anything else.)\n\nI too, following many, and follow’d by many, inaugurate a Religion—I\n  descend into the arena;\n(It may be I am destin’d to utter the loudest cries there, the\n  winner’s pealing shouts;\nWho knows? they may rise from me yet, and soar above every thing.)\n\nEach is not for its own sake;\nI say the whole earth, and all the stars in the sky, are for Religion’s\n  sake.\n\nI say no man has ever yet been half devout enough;\nNone has ever yet adored or worship’d half enough;\nNone has begun to think how divine he himself is, and how certain the future is.\n\n\nI say that the real and permanent grandeur of These States must be their\n  Religion;\nOtherwise there is no real and permanent grandeur:\n(Nor character, nor life worthy the name, without Religion;\nNor land, nor man or woman, without Religion.)\n\n9What are you doing, young man?\nAre you so earnest—so given up to literature, science, art, amours?\nThese ostensible realities, politics, points?\nYour ambition or business, whatever it may be?\n\nIt is well—Against such I say not a word—I am their poet also;\nBut behold! such swiftly subside—burnt up for Religion’s sake;\nFor not all matter is fuel to heat, impalpable flame, the essential life of the\n  earth,\nAny more than such are to Religion.\n\n10What do you seek, so pensive and silent?\nWhat do you need, Camerado?\nDear son! do you think it is love?\n\nListen, dear son—listen, America, daughter or son!\nIt is a painful thing to love a man or woman to excess—and yet it\n  satisfies—it is great;\nBut there is something else very great—it makes the whole coincide;\nIt, magnificent, beyond materials, with continuous hands, sweeps and provides\n  for all.\n\n11Know you! solely to drop in the earth the germs of a greater Religion,\nThe following chants, each for its kind, I sing.\n\nMy comrade!\nFor you, to share with me, two greatnesses—and a third one, rising\n  inclusive and more resplendent,\nThe greatness of Love and Democracy—and the greatness of Religion.\n\nMelange mine own! the unseen and the seen;\nMysterious ocean where the streams empty;\nProphetic spirit of materials shifting and flickering around me;\nLiving beings, identities, now doubtless near us, in the air, that we know not\n  of;\nContact daily and hourly that will not release me;\nThese selecting—these, in hints, demanded of me.\n\nNot he, with a daily kiss, onward from childhood kissing me,\nHas winded and twisted around me that which holds me to him,\nAny more than I am held to the heavens, to the spiritual world,\nAnd to the identities of the Gods, my lovers, faithful and true,\nAfter what they have done to me, suggesting themes.\n\nO such themes! Equalities!\nO amazement of things! O divine average!\nO warblings under the sun—usher’d, as now, or at noon, or setting!\nO strain, musical, flowing through ages—now reaching hither!\nI take to your reckless and composite chords—I add to them, and cheerfully\n  pass them forward.\n\n12As I have walk’d in Alabama my morning walk,\nI have seen where the she-bird, the mocking-bird, sat on her nest in the briers,\n  hatching her brood.\n\nI have seen the he-bird also;\nI have paused to hear him, near at hand, inflating his throat, and joyfully\n  singing.\n\nAnd while I paused, it came to me that what he really sang for was not there\n  only,\nNor for his mate, nor himself only, nor all sent back by the echoes;\nBut subtle, clandestine, away beyond,\nA charge transmitted, and gift occult, for those being born.\n\n13Democracy!\nNear at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and joyfully singing.\n\nMa femme!\nFor the brood beyond us and of us,\nFor those who belong here, and those to come,\nI, exultant, to be ready for them, will now shake out carols stronger and\n  haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon earth.\n\nI will make the songs of passion, to give them their way,\nAnd your songs, outlaw’d offenders—for I scan you with kindred eyes,\n  and carry you with me the same as any.\n\nI will make the true poem of riches,\nTo earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres, and goes forward, and is not\n  dropt by death.\n\nI will effuse egotism, and show it underlying all—and I will be the bard of\n  personality;\nAnd I will show of male and female that either is but the equal of the other;\nAnd sexual organs and acts! do you concentrate in me—for I am\n  determin’d to tell you with courageous clear voice, to prove you\n  illustrious;\nAnd I will show that there is no imperfection in the present—and can be\n  none in the future;\nAnd I will show that whatever happens to anybody, it may be turn’d to\n  beautiful results—and I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful\n  than death;\nAnd I will thread a thread through my poems that time and events are compact,\nAnd that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles, each as profound\n  as any.\n\nI will not make poems with reference to parts;\nBut I will make leaves, poems, poemets, songs, says, thoughts with reference to\n  ensemble:\nAnd I will not sing with reference to a day, but with reference to all days;\nAnd I will not make a poem, nor the least part of a poem, but has reference to\n  the Soul;\n(Because, having look’d at the objects of the universe, I find there is no\n  one, nor any particle of one, but has reference to the Soul.)\n\n14Was somebody asking to see the Soul?\nSee! your own shape and countenance—persons, substances, beasts, the trees,\n  the running rivers, the rocks and sands.\n\nAll hold spiritual joys, and afterwards loosen them:\nHow can the real body ever die, and be buried?\n\nOf your real body, and any man’s or woman’s real body,\nItem for item, it will elude the hands of the corpse-cleaners, and pass to\n  fitting spheres,\nCarrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to the moment of death.\n\nNot the types set up by the printer return their impression, the meaning, the\n  main concern,\nAny more than a man’s substance and life, or a woman’s substance and\n  life, return in the body and the Soul,\nIndifferently before death and after death.\n\nBehold! the body includes and is the meaning, the main concern—and includes\n  and is the Soul;\nWhoever you are! how superb and how divine is your body, or any part of it.\n\n15Whoever you are! to you endless announcements.\n\nDaughter of the lands, did you wait for your poet?\nDid you wait for one with a flowing mouth and indicative hand?\n\nToward the male of The States, and toward the female of The States,\nLive words—words to the lands.\n\nO the lands! interlink’d, food-yielding lands!\nLand of coal and iron! Land of gold! Lands of cotton, sugar, rice!\nLand of wheat, beef, pork! Land of wool and hemp! Land of the apple and grape!\nLand of the pastoral plains, the grass-fields of the world! Land of those\n  sweet-air’d interminable plateaus!\nLand of the herd, the garden, the healthy house of adobie!\nLands where the northwest Columbia winds, and where the southwest Colorado\n  winds!\nLand of the eastern Chesapeake! Land of the Delaware!\nLand of Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan!\nLand of the Old Thirteen! Massachusetts land! Land of Vermont and Connecticut!\nLand of the ocean shores!

Arctic braced! Mexican breez’d! the diverse! the\n  compact!\nThe Pennsylvanian! the Virginian! the double Carolinian!\nO all and each well-loved by me! my intrepid nations! O I at any rate include\n  you all with perfect love!\nI cannot be discharged from you! not from one, any sooner than another!\nO Death! O for all that, I am yet of you, unseen, this hour, with irrepressible\n  love,\nWalking New England, a friend, a traveler,\nSplashing my bare feet in the edge of the summer ripples, on Paumanok’s\n  sands,\nCrossing the prairies—dwelling again in Chicago—dwelling in every\n  town,\nObserving shows, births, improvements, structures, arts,\nListening to the orators and the oratresses in public halls,\nOf and through The States, as during life—each man and woman my neighbor,\nThe Louisianian, the Georgian, as near to me, and I as near to him and her,\nThe Mississippian and Arkansian yet with me—and I yet with any of them;\nYet upon the plains west of the spinal river—yet in my house of adobie,\nYet returning eastward—yet in the Sea-Side State, or in Maryland,\nYet Kanadian, cheerily braving the winter—the snow and ice welcome to me,\nYet a true son either of Maine, or of the Granite State, or of the Narragansett\n  Bay State, or of the Empire State;\nYet sailing to other shores to annex the same—yet welcoming every new\n  brother;\nHereby applying these leaves to the new ones, from the hour they unite with the\n  old ones;\nComing among the new ones myself, to be their companion and equal—coming\n  personally to you now;\nEnjoining you to acts, characters, spectacles, with me.\n\n16With me, with firm holding—yet haste, haste on.\n\nFor your life, adhere to me!\nOf all the men of the earth, I only can unloose you and toughen you;\nI may have to be persuaded many times before I consent to give myself really to\n  you—but what of that?\nMust not Nature be persuaded many times?\n\nNo dainty dolce affettuoso I;\nBearded, sun-burnt, gray-neck’d, forbidding, I have arrived,\nTo be wrestled with as I pass, for the solid prizes of the universe;\nFor such I afford whoever can persevere to win them.\n\n17On my way a moment I pause;\nHere for you! and here for America!\nStill the Present I raise aloft—Still the Future of The States I harbinge,\n  glad and sublime;\nAnd for the Past, I pronounce what the air holds of the red aborigines.\n\nThe red aborigines!\nLeaving natural breaths, sounds of rain and winds, calls as of birds and animals\n  in the woods, syllabled to us for names;\nOkonee, Koosa, Ottawa, Monongahela, Sauk, Natchez, Chattahoochee, Kaqueta,\n  Oronoco,\nWabash, Miami, Saginaw, Chippewa, Oshkosh, Walla-Walla;\nLeaving such to The States, they melt, they depart, charging the water and the\n  land with names.\n\n18O expanding and swift! O henceforth,\nElements, breeds, adjustments, turbulent, quick, and audacious;\nA world primal again—Vistas of glory, incessant and branching;\nA new race, dominating previous ones, and grander far—with new contests,\nNew politics, new literatures and religions, new inventions and arts.\n\nThese! my voice announcing—I will sleep no more, but arise;\nYou oceans that have been calm within me! how I feel you, fathomless, stirring,\n  preparing unprecedented waves and storms.\n\n19See! steamers steaming through my poems!\nSee, in my poems immigrants continually coming and landing;\nSee, in arriere, the wigwam, the trail, the hunter’s hut, the flatboat, the\n  maize-leaf, the claim, the rude fence, and the backwoods village;\nSee, on the one side the Western Sea, and on the other the Eastern Sea, how they\n  advance and retreat upon my poems, as upon their own shores.\n\nSee, pastures and forests in my poems—See, animals, wild and tame—See,\n  beyond the Kanzas, countless herds of buffalo, feeding on short curly grass;\nSee, in my poems, cities, solid, vast, inland, with paved streets, with iron and\n  stone edifices, ceaseless vehicles, and commerce;\nSee, the many-cylinder’d steam printing-press—See, the electric\n  telegraph, stretching across the Continent, from the Western Sea to Manhattan;\nSee, through Atlantica’s depths, pulses American, Europe\n  reaching—pulses of Europe, duly return’d;\nSee, the strong and quick locomotive, as it departs, panting, blowing the\n  steam-whistle;\nSee, ploughmen, ploughing farms—See, miners, digging mines—See, the\n  numberless factories;\nSee, mechanics, busy at their benches, with tools—See from among them,\n  superior judges, philosophs, Presidents, emerge, drest in working dresses;\nSee, lounging through the shops and fields of The States, me, well-belov’d,\n  close-held by day and night;\nHear the loud echoes of my songs there!

{"title":"I Sing the Body Electric.","content":"1\nI SING the Body electric;\nThe armies of those I love engirth me, and I engirth them;\nThey will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,\nAnd discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the Soul.\n\nWas it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves;\nAnd if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead?\nAnd if the body does not do as much as the Soul?\nAnd if the body were not the Soul, what is the Soul?\n\n2\nThe love of the Body of man or woman balks account—the body itself balks account;\nThat of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect.\n\nThe expression of the face balks account;\nBut the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face;\nIt is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists;\n\nIt is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees—dress does\n  not hide him;\nThe strong, sweet, supple quality he has, strikes through the cotton and flannel;\nTo see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more;\nYou linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side.\n\nThe sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress,\n  their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards,\nThe swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent\n  green-shine, or lies with his face up, and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the\n  water,\nThe bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats—the horseman in his saddle,\nGirls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances,\nThe group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives\n  waiting,\nThe female soothing a child—the farmer’s daughter in the garden or cow-yard,\nThe young fellow hoeing corn—the sleigh-driver guiding his six horses through the crowd,\n\nThe wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured,\n  native-born, out on the vacant lot at sundown, after work,\nThe coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance,\nThe upper-hold and the under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes;\nThe march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through\n  clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps,\nThe slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the\n  listening on the alert,\nThe natural, perfect, varied attitudes—the bent head, the curv’d neck, and the\n  counting;\nSuch-like I love—I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother’s breast with the\n  little child,\nSwim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause,\n  listen, and count.\n\n3\nI know a man, a common farmer—the father of five sons;\nAnd in them were the fathers of sons—and in them were the fathers of sons.\n\nThis man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person;\nThe shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, and the\n  immeasurable meaning of his black eyes—the richness and breadth of his manners,\nThese I used to go and visit him to see—he was wise also;\nHe was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old—his sons were massive, clean,\n  bearded, tan-faced, handsome;\nThey and his daughters loved him—all who saw him loved him;\nThey did not love him by allowance—they loved him with personal love;\nHe drank water only—the blood show’d like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his\n  face;\nHe was a frequent gunner and fisher—he sail’d his boat himself—he had a fine one\n  presented to him by a ship-joiner—he had fowling-pieces, presented to him by men that\n  loved him;\nWhen he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him\n  out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang.\n\nYou would wish long and long to be with him—you would wish to sit by him in the boat,\n  that you and he might touch each other.\n\n4\nI have perceiv’d that to be with those I like is enough,\nTo stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,\nTo be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough,\nTo pass among them, or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck\n  for a moment—what is this, then?\nI do not ask any more delight—I swim in it, as in a sea.\n\nThere is something in staying close to men and women, and looking on them, and in the\n  contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well;\nAll things please the soul—but these please the soul well.\n\n5\nThis is the female form;\nA divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot;\nIt attracts with fierce undeniable attraction!\nI am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor—all falls aside but\n  myself and it;\nBooks, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, the atmosphere and the clouds,\n  and what was expected of heaven or fear’d of hell, are now consumed;\nMad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it—the response likewise ungovernable;\nHair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands, all diffused—mine too\n  diffused;\nEbb stung by the flow, and flow stung by the ebb—love-flesh swelling and deliciously\n  aching;\nLimitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and\n  delirious juice;\nBridegroom night of love, working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn;\nUndulating into the willing and yielding day,\nLost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh’d day.\n\nThis is the nucleus—after the child is born of woman, the man is born of woman;\nThis is the bath of birth—this is the merge of small and large, and the outlet again.\n\nBe not ashamed, women—your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest;\nYou are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul.\n\nThe female contains all qualities, and tempers them—she is in her place, and moves with\n  perfect balance;\nShe is all things duly veil’d—she is both passive and active;\nShe is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters.\n\nAs I see my soul reflected in nature;\nAs I see through a mist, one with inexpressible completeness and beauty,\nSee the bent head, and arms folded over the breast—the female I see.\n\n6\nThe male is not less the soul, nor more—he too is in his place;\nHe too is all qualities—he is action and power;\nThe flush of the known universe is in him;\nScorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well;\nThe wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost, become him\n  well—pride is for him;\nThe full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul;\nKnowledge becomes him—he likes it always—he brings everything to the test of himself;\nWhatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail, he strikes soundings at last only\n  here;\n(Where else does he strike soundings, except here?)\n\nThe man’s body is sacred, and the woman’s body is sacred;\nNo matter who it is, it is

slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by their parents.\n\nThe same, at last and at last, when peace is declared,\nHe stands in the room of the old tavern—the well-belov’d soldiers all pass\n    through,\nThe officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns,\nThe chief encircles their necks with his arm, and kisses them on the cheek,\nHe kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another—he shakes hands, and bids good-by\n    to\n  the\n  army.\n\n13\nNow I tell what my mother told me to-day as we sat at dinner together,\nOf when she was a nearly grown girl, living home with her parents on the old homestead.\n\nA red squaw came one breakfast time to the old homestead,\nOn her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush-bottoming chairs,\nHer hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse, half-envelop’d her face,\nHer step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded exquisitely as she spoke.\n\nMy mother look’d in delight and amazement at the stranger,\nShe look’d at the freshness of her tall-borne face, and full and pliant limbs,\nThe more she look’d upon her, she loved her,\nNever before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity,\nShe made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace—she cook’d food for\n    her,\nShe had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance and fondness.\n\nThe red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle of the afternoon she went\n    away,\nO my mother was loth to have her go away!\nAll the week she thought of her—she watch’d for her many a month,\nShe remember’d her many a winter and many a summer,\nBut the red squaw never came, nor was heard of there again.\n\n14\nNow Lucifer was not dead—or if he was, I am his sorrowful terrible heir;\nI have been wrong’d—I am oppress’d—I hate him that oppresses me,\nI will either destroy him, or he shall release me.\n\nDamn him! how he does defile me!\nHow he informs against my brother and sister, and takes pay for their blood!\nHow he laughs when I look down the bend, after the steamboat that carries away my woman!\n\nNow the vast dusk bulk that is the whale’s bulk, it seems mine;\nWarily, sportsman! though I lie so sleepy and sluggish, the tap of my flukes is death.\n\n15\nA show of the summer softness! a contact of something unseen! an amour of the light and\n    air!\nI am jealous, and overwhelm’d with friendliness,\nAnd will go

  and\n  the far\n  behind are to come on in their turns,\nThe diverse shall be no less diverse, but they shall flow and unite—they unite now.\n\n20\nThe sleepers are very beautiful as they lie unclothed,\nThey flow hand in hand over the whole earth, from east to west, as they lie unclothed,\nThe Asiatic and African are hand in hand—the European and American are hand in hand,\nLearn’d and unlearn’d are hand in hand, and male and female are hand in hand,\nThe bare arm of the girl crosses the bare breast of her lover—they press close\n    without\n  lust—his lips press her neck,\nThe father holds his grown or ungrown son in his arms with measureless love, and the son\n    holds\n  the\n  father in his arms with measureless love,\nThe white hair of the mother shines on the white wrist of the daughter,\nThe breath of the boy goes with the breath of the man, friend is inarm’d by friend,\nThe scholar kisses the teacher, and the teacher kisses the scholar—the wrong’d\n    is\n  made\n  right,\nThe call of the slave is one with the master’s call, and the master salutes the\n    slave,\nThe felon steps forth from the prison—the insane becomes sane—the suffering of\n    sick\n  persons is reliev’d,\nThe sweatings and fevers stop—the throat that was unsound is sound—the lungs of\n    the\n  consumptive are resumed—the poor distress’d head is free,\nThe joints of the rheumatic move as smoothly as ever, and smoother than ever,\nStiflings and passages open—the paralyzed become supple,\nThe swell’d and convuls’d and congested awake to themselves in condition,\nThey pass the invigoration of the night, and the chemistry of the night, and awake.\n\n21\nI too pass from the night,\nI stay a while away, O night, but I return to you again, and love you.\n\nWhy should I be afraid to trust myself to you?\nI am not afraid—I have been well brought forward by you;\nI love the rich running day, but I do not desert her in whom I lay so long,\nI know not how I came of you, and I know not where I go with you—but I know I came\n    well,\n  and\n  shall go well.\n\nI will stop only a time with the night, and rise betimes;\nI will duly pass the day, O my mother, and duly return to you."}

fetching it to me with full hands;\nHow could I answer the child? I do not know what it is, any more than he.\n\nI guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven.\n\n\nOr I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,\nA scented gift and remembrancer, designedly dropt,\nBearing the owner’s name someway in the corners, that we may see and\n  remark, and say, Whose?\n\nOr I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation.\n\nOr I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic;\nAnd it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,\nGrowing among black folks as among white;\nKanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the\n  same.\n\nAnd now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.\n\nTenderly will I use you, curling grass;\nIt may be you transpire from the breasts of young men;\nIt may be if I had known them I would have loved them;\nIt may be you are from old people, and from women, and from offspring taken soon\n  out of their mothers’ laps;\nAnd here you are the mothers’ laps.\n\nThis grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers;\nDarker than the colorless beards of old men;\nDark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.\n\nO I perceive after all so many uttering tongues!\nAnd I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.\n\nI wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,\nAnd the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of\n  their laps.\n\nWhat do you think has become of the young and old men?\nAnd what do you think has become of the women and children?\n\nThey are alive and well somewhere;\nThe smallest sprout shows there is really no death;\nAnd if ever there was, it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to\n  arrest it,\nAnd ceas’d the moment life appear’d.\n\nAll goes onward and outward—nothing collapses;\nAnd to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.\n\n7\nHas any one supposed it lucky to be born?\nI hasten to inform him or her, it is just as lucky to die, and I know it.\n\nI pass death with the dying, and birth with the new-wash’d babe, and am not\n  contain’d between my hat and boots;\nAnd peruse manifold objects, no two alike, and every one good;\nThe earth good, and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.\n\nI am not an earth, nor an adjunct of an earth;\nI am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and fathomless as\n  myself;\n(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)\n\nEvery kind for itself and its own—for me mine, male and female;\nFor me those that have been boys, and that love women;\nFor me the man that is proud, and feels how it stings to be slighted;\nFor me the sweet-heart and the old maid—for me mothers, and the mothers of\n  mothers;\nFor me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears;\nFor me children, and the begetters of children.\n\nUndrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale, nor discarded;\nI see through the broadcloth and gingham, whether or no;\nAnd am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away.\n\n8\nThe little one sleeps in its cradle;\nI lift the gauze, and look a long time, and silently brush away flies with my\n  hand.\n\nThe youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill;\nI peeringly view them from the top.\n\nThe suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bed-room;\nI witness the corpse with its dabbled hair—I note where the pistol has\n  fallen.\n\nThe blab of the pave, the tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of the\n  promenaders;\nThe heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the clank of the\n  shod horses on the granite floor;\nThe snow-sleighs, the clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snowballs;\nThe hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous’d mobs;\nThe flap of the curtain’d litter, a sick man inside, borne to the hospital;\nThe meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall;\nThe excited crowd, the policeman with his star, quickly working his passage to\n  the centre of the crowd;\nThe impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes;\nWhat groans of over-fed or half-starv’d who fall sun-struck, or in fits;\nWhat exclamations of women taken suddenly, who hurry home and give birth to\n  babes;\nWhat living and buried speech is always vibrating here—what howls\n  restrain’d by decorum;\nArrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances, rejections\n  with convex lips;\nI mind them or the show or resonance of them—I come, and I depart.\n\n9\nThe big doors of the country barn stand open and ready;\nThe dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon;\nThe clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged;\nThe armfuls are pack’d to the sagging mow.\n\nI am there—I help—I came stretch’d atop of the load;\nI felt its soft jolts—one leg reclined on the other;\nI jump from the cross-beams, and seize the clover and timothy,\nAnd roll head over heels, and tangle my hair full of wisps.\n\n10\nAlone, far in the wilds and mountains, I hunt,\nWandering, amazed at my own lightness and glee;\nIn the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,\nKindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill’d game;\nFalling asleep on the gather’d leaves, with my dog and gun by my side.\n\nThe Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails—she cuts the sparkle and scud;\nMy eyes settle the land—I bend at her prow, or shout joyously from the\n  deck.\n\nThe boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me;\nI tuck’d my trowser-ends in my boots, and went and had a good time:\n(You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.)\n\nI saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west—the bride\n  was a red girl;\nHer father and his friends sat near, cross-legged and dumbly smoking—they\n  had moccasins to their feet, and large thick blankets hanging from their\n  shoulders;\nOn a bank lounged the trapper—he was drest mostly in skins—his\n  luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck—he held his bride by the hand;\n\nShe had long eyelashes—her head was bare—her coarse straight locks\n  descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach’d to her feet.\n\nThe runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside;\nI heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile;\nThrough the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,\nAnd went where he sat on a log, and led him in and assured him,\nAnd brought water, and fill’d a tub for his sweated body and bruis’d\n  feet,\nAnd gave him a room that enter’d from my own, and gave him some coarse\n  clean clothes,\nAnd remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,\nAnd remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;\nHe staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass’d north;\n(I had him sit next me at table—my fire-lock lean’d in the corner.)\n\n11\nTwenty-eight young men bathe by the shore;\nTwenty-eight young men, and all so friendly:\nTwenty-eight years of womanly life, and all so lonesome.\n\nShe owns the fine house by the rise of the bank;\nShe hides, handsome and richly drest, aft the blinds of the window.\n\nWhich of the young men does she like the best?\nAh, the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.\n\nWhere are you off to, lady? for I see you;\nYou splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.\n\nDancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather;\nThe rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.\n\nThe beards of the young men glisten’d with wet, it ran from their long\n  hair:\nLittle streams pass’d all over their bodies.\n\nAn unseen hand also pass’d over their bodies;\nIt descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.\n\nThe young men float on their backs—their white bellies bulge to the\n  sun—they do not ask who seizes fast to them;\nThey do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch;\nThey do not think whom they souse with spray.\n\n12\nThe butcher-boy puts off his killing clothes, or sharpens his knife at the stall\n  in the market;\nI loiter, enjoying his repartee, and his shuffle and break-down.\n\nBlacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil;\nEach has his main-sledge—they are all out—(there is a great heat in\n  the fire.)\n\nFrom the cinder-strew’d threshold I follow their movements;\nThe lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms;\nOver-hand the hammers swing—over-hand so slow—over-hand so sure:\nThey do not hasten—each man hits in his place.\n\n13\nThe negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses—the block swags\n  underneath on its tied-over chain;\nThe negro that drives the dray of the stone-yard—steady and tall he stands,\n  pois’d on one leg on the string-piece;\nHis blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast, and loosens over his hip-band;\n\nHis glance is calm and commanding—he tosses the slouch of his hat away from\n  his forehead;\nThe sun falls on his crispy hair and moustache—falls on the black of his\n  polish’d and perfect limbs.\n\nI behold the picturesque giant, and love him—and I do not stop there;\nI go with the team also.\n\nIn me the caresser of life wherever moving—backward as well as forward\n  slueing;\nTo niches aside and junior bending.\n\nOxen that rattle the yoke and chain, or halt in the leafy shade! what is that\n  you express in your eyes?\nIt seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.\n\nMy tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck, on my distant and day-long ramble;\n\nThey rise together—they slowly circle around.\n\nI believe in those wing’d purposes,\nAnd acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,\nAnd consider green and violet, and the tufted crown, intentional;\nAnd do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else;\nAnd the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me;\nAnd the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.\n\n14\nThe wild gander leads his flock through the cool night;\nYa-honk! he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation;\n(The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listen close;\nI find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.)\n\nThe sharp-hoof’d moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the\n  chickadee, the prairie-dog,\nThe litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,\nThe brood of the turkey-hen, and she with her half-spread wings;\nI see in them and myself the same old law.\n\nThe press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections;\nThey scorn the best I can do to relate them.\n\nI am enamour’d of growing out-doors,\nOf men that live among cattle, or taste of the ocean or woods,\nOf the builders and steerers of ships, and the wielders of axes and mauls, and\n  the drivers of horses;\nI can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.\n\nWhat is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me;\nMe going in for my chances, spending for vast returns;\nAdorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me;\nNot asking the sky to come down to my good will;\nScattering it freely forever.\n\n15\nThe pure contralto sings in the organ loft;\nThe carpenter dresses his plank—the tongue of his foreplane whistles its\n  wild ascending lisp;\nThe married and unmarried children ride home to their Thanksgiving dinner;\nThe pilot seizes the king-pin—he heaves down with a strong arm;\nThe mate stands braced in the whale-boat—lance and harpoon are ready;\nThe duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches;\nThe deacons are ordain’d with cross’d hands at the altar;\nThe spinning-girl retreats and advances to

fire-balls like the rest;\nCarrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly;\nStorming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,\nBacking and filling, appearing and disappearing;\nI tread day and night such roads.\n\nI visit the orchards of spheres, and look at the product:\nAnd look at quintillions ripen’d, and look at quintillions green.\n\nI fly the flight of the fluid and swallowing soul;\nMy course runs below the soundings of plummets.\n\nI help myself to material and immaterial;\nNo guard can shut me off, nor law prevent me.\n\nI anchor my ship for a little while only;\nMy messengers continually cruise away, or bring their returns to me.\n\nI go hunting polar furs and the seal—leaping chasms with a pike-pointed\n  staff—clinging to topples of brittle and blue.\n\nI ascend to the foretruck;\nI take my place late at night in the crow’s-nest;\nWe sail the arctic sea—it is plenty light enough;\nThrough the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty;\nThe enormous masses of ice pass me, and I pass them—the scenery is plain in\n  all directions;\nThe white-topt mountains show in the distance—I fling out my fancies toward\n  them;\n(We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to be engaged;\nWe pass the colossal outposts of the encampment—we pass with still feet and\n  caution;\nOr we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin’d city;\nThe blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the\n  globe.)\n\nI am a free companion—I bivouac by invading watchfires.\n\nI turn the bridegroom out of bed, and stay with the bride myself;\nI tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.\n\nMy voice is the wife’s voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs;\nThey fetch my man’s body up, dripping and drown’d.\n\nI understand the large hearts of heroes,\nThe courage of present times and all times;\nHow the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steam-ship, and\n  Death chasing it up and down the storm;\nHow he knuckled tight, and gave not back one inch, and was faithful of days and\n  faithful of nights,\nAnd chalk’d in large letters, on a board, Be of good cheer, we will not\n  desert you:\nHow he follow’d with them, and tack’d with them—and would not\n  give it up;\nHow he saved the drifting company at last:\nHow the lank loose-gown’d women look’d when boated from the side of\n  their prepared graves;\nHow the silent old-faced infants, and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipp’d\n  unshaved men:\nAll this I swallow—it tastes good—I like it well—it becomes mine;\nI am the man—I suffer’d—I was there.\n\nThe disdain and calmness of olden martyrs;\nThe mother, condemn’d for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her children gazing\n  on;\nThe hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence, blowing,\n  cover’d with sweat;\nThe twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck—the murderous\n  buckshot and the bullets;\nAll these I feel, or am.\n\nI am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,\nHell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen;\nI clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn’d with the ooze of my\n  skin;\nI fall on the weeds and stones;\nThe riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,\nTaunt my dizzy ears, and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.\n\nAgonies are one of my changes of garments;\nI do not ask the wounded person how he feels—I myself become the wounded\n  person;\nMy hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.\n\nI am the mash’d fireman with breast-bone broken;\nTumbling walls buried me in their debris;\nHeat and smoke I inspired—I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades;\nI heard the distant click of their picks and shovels;\nThey have clear’d the beams away—they tenderly lift me forth.\n\nI lie in the night air in my red shirt—the pervading hush is for my sake;\nPainless after all I lie, exhausted but not so unhappy;\nWhite and beautiful are the faces around me—the heads are bared of their\n  fire-caps;\nThe kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.\n\nDistant and dead resuscitate;\nThey show as the dial or move as the hands of me—I am the clock myself.\n\nI am an old artillerist—I tell of my fort’s bombardment;\nI am there again.\n\nAgain the long roll of the drummers;\nAgain the attacking cannon, mortars;\nAgain, to my listening ears, the cannon responsive.\n\nI take part—I see and hear the whole;\nThe cries, curses, roar—the plaudits for well-aim’d shots;\nThe ambulanza slowly passing, trailing its red drip;\nWorkmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs;\nThe fall of grenades through the rent roof—the fan-shaped explosion;\nThe whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.\n\nAgain gurgles the mouth of my dying general—he furiously waves with his\n  hand;\nHe gasps through the clot, Mind not me—mind—the entrenchments.\n\n34\nNow I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth;\n(I tell not the fall of Alamo,\nNot one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,\nThe hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo;)\n’Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young\n  men.\n\nRetreating, they had form’d in a hollow square, with their baggage for\n  breastworks;\nNine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy’s, nine times their number,\n  was the price they took in advance;\nTheir colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone;\nThey treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv’d writing and seal, gave\n  up their arms, and march’d back prisoners of war.\n\nThey were the glory of the race of rangers;\nMatchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,\nLarge, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,\nBearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,\nNot a single one over thirty years of age.\n\nThe second First-day morning they were brought out in squads, and\n  massacred—it was beautiful early summer;\nThe work commenced about five o’clock, and was over by eight.\n\nNone obey’d the command to kneel;\nSome made a mad and helpless rush—some stood stark and straight;\nA few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart—the living and dead lay\n  together;\nThe maim’d and mangled dug in the dirt—the newcomers saw them there;\nSome, half-kill’d, attempted to crawl away;\nThese were despatch’d with bayonets, or batter’d with the blunts of\n  muskets;\nA youth not seventeen years old seiz’d his assassin till two more came to\n  release him;\nThe three were all torn, and cover’d with the boy’s blood.\n\nAt eleven o’clock began the burning of the bodies:\nThat is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.\n\n35\nWould you hear of an old-fashion’d sea-fight?\nWould you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?\nList to the story as my grandmother’s father, the sailor, told it to me.\n\nOur foe was no skulk in his ship, I tell you, (said he;)\nHis was the surly English pluck—and there is no tougher or truer, and never\n  was, and never will be;\nAlong the lower’d eve he came, horribly raking us.\n\nWe closed with him—the yards entangled—the cannon touch’d;\nMy captain lash’d fast with his own hands.\n\nWe had receiv’d some eighteen pound shots under the water;\nOn our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all\n  around, and blowing up overhead.\n\nFighting at sun-down, fighting at dark;\nTen o’clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and\n  five feet of water reported;\nThe master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the afterhold, to give them\n  a chance for themselves.\n\nThe transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,\nThey see so many strange faces, they do not know whom to trust.\n\nOur frigate takes fire;\nThe other asks if we demand quarter?\nIf our colors are struck, and the fighting is done?\n\nNow I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,\nWe have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part\n  of the fighting.\n\nOnly three guns are in use;\nOne is directed by the captain himself against the enemy’s mainmast;\nTwo, well served with grape and canister, silence his musketry and clear his\n  decks.\n\nThe tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top;\nThey hold out bravely during the whole of the action.\n\nNot a moment’s cease;\nThe leaks gain fast on the pumps—the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.\n\nOne of the pumps has been shot away—it is generally thought we are sinking.\n\n\nSerene stands the little captain;\nHe is not hurried—his voice is neither high nor low;\nHis eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.\n\nToward twelve at night, there in the beams of the moon, they surrender to us.\n\n36\nStretch’d and still lies the midnight;\nTwo great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness;\nOur vessel riddled and slowly sinking—preparations to pass to the one we\n  have conquer’d;\nThe captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance\n  white as a sheet;\nNear by, the corpse of the child that serv’d in the cabin;\nThe dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curl’d\n  whiskers;\nThe flames, spite of all that can be done, flickering aloft and below;\nThe husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty;\nFormless stacks of bodies, and bodies by themselves—dabs of flesh upon the\n  masts and spars,\nCut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,\nBlack and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,\nDelicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore,\n  death-messages given in charge to survivors,\nThe hiss of the surgeon’s knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,\nWheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long, dull,\n  tapering groan;\nThese so—these irretrievable.\n\n37\nO Christ! This is mastering me!\nIn at the conquer’d doors they crowd. I am possess’d.\n\nI embody all presences outlaw’d or suffering;\nSee myself in prison shaped like another man,\nAnd feel the dull unintermitted pain.\n\nFor me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch;\nIt is I let out"}

chamber door--\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;--\n    This it is and nothing more.\"\n\nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n\"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping--tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you\"--here I opened wide the door:--\n      Darkness there and nothing more.\n\nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,\n  fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\"\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"\n      Merely this and nothing more.\n\nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon I heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before.\n\"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--\nLet my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;--\n    'Tis the wind and nothing more.\"\n\nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he: not an instant stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--\n    Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\n\nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n\"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no\n  craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\n      With such name as \"Nevermore.\"\n\nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--\nTill I scarcely more than muttered, \"Other friends have flown before--\nOn the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.\"\n      Then the bird said, \"Nevermore.\"\n\nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store,\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--\nTill the dirges of his Hope the melancholy burden bore\n    Of 'Never--nevermore.'\"\n\nBut the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and\n  door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\n    Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"\n\nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,\nBut whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,\n      _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!\n\nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n\"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath\n  sent thee\nRespite--respite aad nepenthé from thy memories of Lenore!\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthé, and forget this lost Lenore!\"\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--\nOn this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--\nIs there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!\"\n    Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n\"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\" I shrieked,\n  upstarting--\n\"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"\n    Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\n    Shall be lifted--nevermore!"}

Yet when I approach\nTo catch the sound's completeness, to absorb\nThe faces' full perfection, Heaven's gate,\nWhich then had stood ajar, sudden falls to,\nAnd I, a-shiver in the dark and cold,\nScarce hear afar the mocking tones of men:\n\"He would not dig, forsooth ; but he must strive\nFor higher fruits than what our tillage yields;\nBehold what comes, my brothers, of vain pride!\"\nWhy play with figures? trifle prettily\nWith this my grief which very simply's said,\n\"There is no place for me in all the world\"?\nThe world's a rock, and I will beat no more\nA breast of flesh and blood against a rock. . .\nA stride across the planks for old time's sake.\nAh, bare, small room that I have sorrowed in;\nAy, and on sunny days, haply, rejoiced;\nWe know some things together, you and I!\nHold there, you rangèd row of books ! In vain\nYou beckon from your shelf. You've stood my friends\nWhere all things else were foes; yet now I'll turn\nMy back upon you, even as the world\nTurns it on me. And yet--farewell, farewell!\nYou, lofty Shakespere, with the tattered leaves\nAnd fathomless great heart, your binding's bruised\nYet did I love you less? Goethe, farewell;\nFarewell, triumphant smile and tragic eyes,\nAnd pitiless world-wisdom!\n\nFor all men\nThese two. And 'tis farewell with you, my friends,\nMore dear because more near: Theokritus;\nHeine that stings and smiles; Prometheus' bard;\n(I've grown too coarse for Shelley latterly:)\nAnd one wild singer of to-day, whose song\nIs all aflame with passionate bard's blood\nLash'd into foam by pain and the world's wrong.\nAt least, he has a voice to cry his pain;\nFor him, no silent writhing in the dark,\nNo muttering of mute lips, no straining out\nOf a weak throat a-choke with pent-up sound,\nA-throb with pent-up passion. . .\nAh, my sun!\nThat's you, then, at the window, looking in\nTo beam farewell on one who's loved you long\nAnd very truly. Up, you creaking thing,\nYou squinting, cobwebbed casement!\nSo, at last,\nI can drink in the sunlight. How it falls.\nAcross that endless sea of London roofs,\nWeaving such golden wonders on the grey,\nThat almost, for the moment, we forget\nThe world of woe beneath them.\nUnderneath,\nFor all the sunset glory, Pain is king.\n\nYet, the sun's there, and very sweet withal;\nAnd I'll not grumble that it's only sun,\nBut open wide my lips--thus--drink it in;\nTurn up my face to the sweet evening sky\n(What royal wealth of scarlet on the blue\nSo tender toned, you'd almost think it green)\nAnd stretch my hands out--so--to grasp it tight.\nHa, ha! 'tis sweet awhile to cheat the Fates,\nAnd be as happy as another man.\nThe sun works in my veins like wine, like wine!\n'Tis a fair world: if dark, indeed, with woe,\nYet having hope and hint of such a joy,\nThat a man, winning, well might turn aside,\nCareless of Heaven . . .\nO enough; I turn\nFrom the sun's light, or haply I shall hope.\nI have hoped enough; I would not hope again:\n'Tis hope that is most cruel.\nTom, my friend,\nYou very sorry philosophic fool;\n'Tis you, I think, that bid me be resign'd,\nTrust, and be thankful.\nOut on you! Resign'd?\nI'm not resign'd, not patient, not school'd in\nTo take my starveling's portion and pretend\nI'm grateful for it. I want all, all, all;\nI've appetite for all. I want the best:\nLove, beauty, sunlight, nameless joy of life.\nThere's too much patience in the world, I think.\nWe have grown base with crooking of the knee.\nMankind--say--God has bidden to a feast;\nThe board is spread, and groans with cates and drinks;\nIn troop the guests; each man with appetite\nKeen-whetted with expectance.\nIn they troop,\nStruggle for seats, jostle and push and seize.\nWhat's this? what's this? There are not seats for all!\nSome men must stand without the gates; and some\nMust linger by the table, ill-supplied\nWith broken meats. One man gets meat for two,\nThe while another hungers. If I stand\nWithout the portals, seeing others eat\nWhere I had thought to satiate the pangs\nOf mine own hunger; shall I then come forth\nWhen all is done, and drink my Lord's good health\nIn my Lord's water? Shall I not rather turn\nAnd curse him, curse him for a niggard host?\nO, I have hungered, hungered, through the years,\nTill appetite grows craving, then disease;\nI am starved, wither'd, shrivelled.\nPeace, O peace!\nThis rage is idle; what avails to curse\nThe nameless forces, the vast silences\nThat work in all things.\nThis time is the third,\nI wrought before in heat, stung mad with pain,\nBlind, scarcely understanding; now I know\nWhat thing I do.\nThere was a woman once;\nDeep eyes she had, white hands, a subtle smile,\nSoft speaking tones: she did not break my heart,\nYet haply had her heart been otherwise\nMine had not now been broken. Yet, who knows?\nMy life was jarring discord from the first:\nTho' here and there brief hints of melody,\nOf melody unutterable, clove the air.\nFrom this bleak world, into the heart of night,\nThe dim, deep bosom of the universe,\nI cast myself. I only crave for rest;\nToo heavy is the load. I fling it down.\n\n\nEPILOGUE.\n\nWe knocked and knocked; at last, burst in the door,\nAnd found him as you know--the outstretched arms\nPropping the hidden face. The sun had set,\nAnd all the place was dim with lurking shade.\nThere was no written word to say farewell,\nOr make more clear the deed.\nI search'd and search'd;\nThe room held little: just a row of books\nMuch scrawl'd and noted; sketches on the wall,\nDone rough in charcoal; the old instrument\n(A violin, no Stradivarius)\nHe played so ill on; in the table drawer\nLarge schemes of undone work. Poems half-writ;\nWild drafts of symphonies; big plans of fugues;\nSome scraps of writing in a woman's hand:\nNo more--the scattered pages of a tale,\nA sorry tale that no man cared to read.\nAlas, my friend, I lov'd him well, tho' he\nHeld me a cold and stagnant-blooded fool,\nBecause I am content to watch, and wait\nWith a calm mind the issue of all things.\nCertain it is my blood's no turbid stream;\nYet, for all that, haply I understood\nMore than he ever deem'd; nor held so light\nThe poet in him. Nay, I sometimes doubt\nIf they have not, indeed, the better part--\nThese poets, who get drunk with sun, and weep\nBecause the night or a woman's face is fair.\nMeantime there is much talk about my friend.\nThe women say, of course, he died for love;\nThe men, for lack of gold, or cavilling\nOf carping critics. I, Tom Leigh, his friend\nI have no word at all to say of this.\nNay, I had deem'd him more philosopher;\nFor did he think by this one paltry deed\nTo cut the knot of circumstance, and snap\nThe chain which binds all being?"}

{"title":"The Ballad Of Reading Gaol","content":"(In memoriam\nC. T. W.\nSometime trooper of the Royal Horse Guards\nobiit H.M. prison, Reading, Berkshire\nJuly 7, 1896)\n\nI\n\nHe did not wear his scarlet coat,\nFor blood and wine are red,\nAnd blood and wine were on his hands\nWhen they found him with the dead,\nThe poor dead woman whom he loved,\nAnd murdered in her bed.\n\nHe walked amongst the Trial Men\nIn a suit of shabby grey;\nA cricket cap was on his head,\nAnd his step seemed light and gay;\nBut I never saw a man who looked\nSo wistfully at the day.\n\nI never saw a man who looked\nWith such a wistful eye\nUpon that little tent of blue\nWhich prisoners call the sky,\nAnd at every drifting cloud that went\nWith sails of silver by.\n\nI walked, with other souls in pain,\nWithin another ring,\nAnd was wondering if the man had done\nA great or little thing,\nWhen a voice behind me whispered low,\n'THAT FELLOW'S GOT TO SWING.'\n\nDear Christ! the very prison walls\nSuddenly seemed to reel,\nAnd the sky above my head became\nLike a casque of scorching steel;\nAnd, though I was a soul in pain,\nMy pain I could not feel.\n\nI only knew what hunted thought\nQuickened his step, and why\nHe looked upon the garish day\nWith such a wistful eye;\nThe man had killed the thing he loved,\nAnd so he had to die.\n\n\nYet each man kills the thing he loves,\nBy each let this be heard,\nSome do it with a bitter look,\nSome with a flattering word,\nThe coward does it with a kiss,\nThe brave man with a sword!\n\nSome kill their love when they are young,\nAnd some when they are old;\nSome strangle with the hands of Lust,\nSome with the hands of Gold:\nThe kindest use a knife, because\nThe dead so soon grow cold.\n\nSome love too little, some too long,\nSome sell, and others buy;\nSome do the deed with many tears,\nAnd some without a sigh:\nFor each man kills the thing he loves,\nYet each man does not die.\n\nHe does not die a death of shame\nOn a day of dark disgrace,\nNor have a noose about his neck,\nNor a cloth upon his face,\nNor drop feet foremost through the floor\nInto an empty space.\n\n\nHe does not sit with silent men\nWho watch him night and day;\nWho watch him when he tries to weep,\nAnd when he tries to pray;\nWho watch him lest himself should rob\nThe prison of its prey.\n\nHe does not wake at dawn to see\nDread figures throng his room,\nThe shivering Chaplain robed in white,\nThe Sheriff stern with gloom,\nAnd the Governor all in shiny black,\nWith the yellow face of Doom.\n\nHe does not rise in piteous haste\nTo put on convict-clothes,\nWhile some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats,\nand notes\nEach new and nerve-twitched pose,\nFingering a watch whose little ticks\nAre like horrible hammer-blows.\n\nHe does not know that sickening thirst\nThat sands one's throat, before\nThe hangman with his gardener's gloves\nSlips through the padded door,\nAnd binds one with three leathern thongs,\nThat the throat may thirst no more.\n\nHe does not bend his head to hear\nThe Burial Office read,\nNor, while the terror of his soul\nTells him he is not dead,\nCross his own coffin, as he moves\nInto the hideous shed.\n\nHe does not stare upon the air\nThrough a little roof of glass:\nHe does not pray with lips of clay\nFor his agony to pass;\nNor feel upon his shuddering cheek\nThe kiss of Caiaphas.\n\n\nII\n\n\nSix weeks our guardsman walked the yard,\nIn the suit of shabby grey:\nHis cricket cap was on his head,\nAnd his step seemed light and gay,\nBut I never saw a man who looked\nSo wistfully at the day.\n\nI never saw a man who looked\nWith such a wistful eye\nUpon that little tent of blue\nWhich prisoners call the sky,\nAnd at every wandering cloud that trailed\nIts ravelled fleeces by.\n\nHe did not wring his hands, as do\nThose witless men who dare\nTo try to rear the changeling Hope\nIn the cave of black Despair:\nHe only looked upon the sun,\nAnd drank the morning air.\n\nHe did not wring his hands nor weep,\nNor did he peek or pine,\nBut he drank the air as though it held\nSome healthful anodyne;\nWith open mouth he drank the sun\nAs though it had been wine!\n\nAnd I and all the souls in pain,\nWho tramped the other ring,\nForgot if we ourselves had done\nA great or little thing,\nAnd watched with gaze of dull amaze\nThe man who had to swing.\n\nAnd strange it was to see him pass\nWith a step so light and gay,\nAnd strange it was to see him look\nSo wistfully at the day,\nAnd strange it was to think that he\nHad such a debt to pay.\n\n\nFor oak and elm have pleasant leaves\nThat in the springtime shoot:\nBut grim to see is the gallows-tree,\nWith its adder-bitten root,\nAnd, green or dry, a man must die\nBefore it bears its fruit!\n\nThe loftiest place is that seat of grace\nFor which all worldlings try:\nBut who would stand in hempen band\nUpon a scaffold high,\nAnd through a murderer's collar take\nHis last look at the sky?\n\nIt is sweet to dance to violins\nWhen Love and Life are fair:\nTo dance to flutes, to dance to lutes\nIs delicate and rare:\nBut it is not sweet with nimble feet\nTo dance upon the air!\n\nSo with curious eyes and sick surmise\nWe watched him day by day,\nAnd wondered if each one of us\nWould end the self-same way,\nFor none can tell to what red Hell\nHis sightless soul may stray.\n\nAt last the dead man walked no more\nAmongst the Trial Men,\nAnd I knew that he was standing up\nIn the black dock's dreadful pen,\nAnd that never would I see his face\nIn God's sweet world again.\n\nLike two doomed ships that pass in storm\nWe had crossed each other's way:\nBut we made no sign, we said no word,\nWe had no word to say;\nFor we did not meet in the holy night,\nBut in the shameful day.\n\nA prison wall was round us both,\nTwo outcast men we were:\nThe world had thrust us from its heart,\nAnd God from out His care:\nAnd the iron gin that waits for Sin\nHad caught us in its snare.\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIn Debtors' Yard the stones are hard,\nAnd the dripping wall is high,\nSo it was there he took the air\nBeneath the leaden sky,\nAnd by each side a Warder walked,\nFor fear the man might die.\n\nOr else he sat with those who watched\nHis anguish night and day;\nWho watched him when he rose to weep,\nAnd when he crouched to pray;\nWho watched him lest himself should rob\nTheir scaffold of its prey.\n\nThe Governor was strong upon\nThe Regulations Act:\nThe Doctor said that Death was but\nA scientific fact:\nAnd twice a day the Chaplain called,\nAnd left a little tract.\n\nAnd twice a day he smoked his pipe,\nAnd drank his quart of beer:\nHis soul was resolute, and held\nNo hiding-place for fear;\nHe often said that he was glad\nThe hangman's hands were near.\n\nBut why he said so strange a thing\nNo Warder dared to ask:\nFor he to whom a watcher's doom\nIs given as his task,\nMust set a lock upon his lips,\nAnd make his face a mask.\n\nOr else he might be moved, and try\nTo comfort or console:\nAnd what should Human Pity do\nPent up in Murderers' Hole?\nWhat word of grace in such a place\nCould help a brother's soul?\n\n\nWith slouch and swing around the ring\nWe trod the Fools' Parade!\nWe did not care: we knew we were\nThe Devil's Own Brigade:\nAnd shaven head and feet of lead\nMake a merry masquerade.\n\nWe tore the tarry rope to shreds\nWith blunt and bleeding nails;\nWe rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,\nAnd cleaned the shining rails:\nAnd, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,\nAnd clattered with the pails.\n\nWe sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,\nWe turned the dusty drill:\nWe banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,\nAnd sweated on the mill:\nBut in the heart of every man\nTerror was lying still.\n\nSo still it lay that every day\nCrawled like a weed-clogged wave:\nAnd we forgot the bitter lot\nThat waits for fool and knave,\nTill once, as we tramped in from work,\nWe passed an open grave.\n\nWith yawning mouth the yellow hole\nGaped for a living thing;\nThe very mud cried out for blood\nTo the thirsty asphalte ring:\nAnd we knew that ere one dawn grew fair\nSome prisoner had to swing.\n\nRight in we went, with soul intent\nOn Death and Dread and Doom:\nThe hangman, with his little bag,\nWent shuffling through the gloom:\nAnd each man trembled as he crept\nInto his numbered tomb.\n\n\nThat night the empty corridors\nWere full of forms of Fear,\nAnd up and down the iron town\nStole feet we could not hear,\nAnd through the bars that hide the stars\nWhite faces seemed to peer.\n\nHe lay as one who lies and dreams\nIn a pleasant meadow-land,\nThe watchers watched him as he slept,\nAnd could not understand\nHow one could sleep so sweet a sleep\nWith a hangman close at hand.\n\nBut there is no sleep when men must weep\nWho never yet have wept:\nSo we - the fool, the fraud, the knave -\nThat endless vigil kept,\nAnd through each brain on hands of pain\nAnother's terror crept.\n\nAlas! it is a fearful thing\nTo feel another's guilt!\nFor, right within, the sword of Sin\nPierced to its poisoned hilt,\nAnd as molten lead were the tears we shed\nFor the blood we had not spilt.\n\nThe Warders with their shoes of felt\nCrept by each padlocked door,\nAnd peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,\nGrey figures on the floor,\nAnd wondered why men knelt to pray\nWho never prayed before.\n\nAll through the night we knelt and prayed,\nMad mourners of a corse!\nThe troubled plumes of midnight were\nThe plumes upon a hearse:\nAnd bitter wine upon a sponge\nWas the savour of Remorse.\n\n\nThe grey cock crew, the red cock crew,\nBut never came the day:\nAnd crooked shapes of Terror crouched,\nIn the corners where we lay:\nAnd each evil sprite that walks by night\nBefore us seemed to play.\n\nThey glided past, they glided fast,\nLike travellers through a mist:\nThey mocked the moon in a rigadoon\nOf delicate turn and twist,\nAnd with formal pace and loathsome grace\nThe phantoms kept their tryst.\n\nWith mop and mow, we saw them go,\nSlim shadows hand in hand:\nAbout, about, in ghostly rout\nThey trod a saraband:\nAnd the damned grotesques made arabesques,\nLike the wind upon the sand!\n\nWith the pirouettes of marionettes,\nThey tripped on pointed tread:\nBut with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,\nAs their grisly masque they led,\nAnd loud they sang, and long they sang,\nFor they sang to wake the dead.\n\n'Oho!' they cried, 'The world is wide,\nBut fettered limbs go lame!\nAnd once, or twice, to throw the dice\nIs a gentlemanly game,\nBut he does not win who plays with Sin\nIn the secret House of Shame.'\n\nNo things of air these antics were,\nThat frolicked with such glee:\nTo men whose lives were held in gyves,\nAnd whose feet might not go free,\nAh! wounds of Christ! they were living things,\nMost terrible to see.\n\nAround, around, they waltzed and wound;\nSome wheeled in smirking pairs;\nWith the mincing step of a demirep\nSome sidled up the stairs:\nAnd with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,\nEach helped us at our prayers.\n\nThe morning wind began to moan,\nBut still the night went on:\nThrough its giant loom the web of gloom\nCrept till each thread was spun:\nAnd, as we prayed, we grew afraid\nOf the Justice of the Sun.\n\nThe moaning wind went wandering round\nThe weeping prison-wall:\nTill like a wheel of turning steel\nWe felt the minutes crawl:\nO moaning wind! what had we done\nTo have such a seneschal?\n\nAt last I saw the shadowed bars,\nLike a lattice wrought in lead,\nMove right across the whitewashed wall\nThat faced my three-plank bed,\nAnd I knew that somewhere in the world\nGod's dreadful dawn was red.\n\nAt six o'clock we cleaned our cells,\nAt seven all was still,\nBut the sough and swing of a mighty wing\nThe prison seemed to fill,\nFor the Lord of Death with icy breath\nHad entered in to kill.\n\nHe did not pass in purple pomp,\nNor ride a moon-white steed.\nThree yards of cord and a sliding board\nAre all the gallows' need:\nSo with rope of shame the Herald came\nTo do the secret deed.\n\nWe were as men who through a fen\nOf filthy darkness grope:\nWe did not dare to breathe a prayer,\nOr to give our anguish scope:\nSomething was dead in each of us,\nAnd what was dead was Hope.\n\nFor Man's grim Justice goes its way,\nAnd will not swerve aside:\nIt slays the weak, it slays the strong,\nIt has a deadly stride:\nWith iron heel it slays the strong,\nThe monstrous parricide!\n\nWe waited for the stroke of eight:\nEach tongue was thick with thirst:\nFor the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate\nThat makes a man accursed,\nAnd Fate will use a running noose\nFor the best man and the worst.\n\nWe had no other thing to do,\nSave to wait for the sign to come:\nSo, like things of stone in a valley lone,\nQuiet we sat and dumb:\nBut each man's heart beat thick and quick,\nLike a madman on a drum!\n\nWith sudden shock the prison-clock\nSmote on the shivering air,\nAnd from all the gaol rose up a wail\nOf impotent despair,\nLike the sound that frightened marshes hear\nFrom some leper in his lair.\n\nAnd as one sees most fearful things\nIn the crystal of a dream,\nWe saw the greasy hempen rope\nHooked to the blackened beam,\nAnd heard the prayer the hangman's snare\nStrangled into a scream.\n\nAnd all the woe that moved him so\nThat he gave that bitter cry,\nAnd the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,\nNone knew so well as I:\nFor he who lives more lives than one\nMore deaths than one must die.\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThere is no chapel on the day\nOn which they hang a man:\nThe Chaplain's heart is far too sick,\nOr his face is far too wan,\nOr there is that written in his eyes\nWhich none should look upon.\n\nSo they kept us close till nigh on noon,\nAnd then they rang the bell,\nAnd the Warders with their jingling keys\nOpened each listening cell,\nAnd down the iron stair we tramped,\nEach from his separate Hell.\n\nOut into God's sweet air we went,\nBut not in wonted way,\nFor this man's face was white with fear,\nAnd that man's face was grey,\nAnd I never saw sad men who looked\nSo wistfully at the day.\n\nI never saw sad men who looked\nWith such a wistful eye\nUpon that little tent of blue\nWe prisoners called the sky,\nAnd at every careless cloud that passed\nIn happy freedom by.\n\nBut there were those amongst us all\nWho walked with downcast head,\nAnd knew that, had each got his due,\nThey should have died instead:\nHe had but killed a thing that lived,\nWhilst they had killed the dead.\n\nFor he who sins a second time\nWakes a dead soul to pain,\nAnd draws it from its spotted shroud,\nAnd makes it bleed again,\nAnd makes it bleed great gouts of blood,\nAnd makes it bleed in vain!\n\n\nLike ape or clown, in monstrous garb\nWith crooked arrows starred,\nSilently we went round and round\nThe slippery asphalte yard;\nSilently we went round and round,\nAnd no man spoke a word.\n\nSilently we went round and round,\nAnd through each hollow mind\nThe Memory of dreadful things\nRushed like a dreadful wind,\nAnd Horror stalked before each man,\nAnd Terror crept behind.\n\n\nThe Warders strutted up and down,\nAnd kept their herd of brutes,\nTheir uniforms were spick and span,\nAnd they wore their Sunday suits,\nBut we knew the work they had been at,\nBy the quicklime on their boots.\n\nFor where a grave had opened wide,\nThere was no grave at all:\nOnly a stretch of mud and sand\nBy the hideous prison-wall,\nAnd a little heap of burning lime,\nThat the man should have his pall.\n\nFor he has a pall, this wretched man,\nSuch as few men can claim:\nDeep down below a prison-yard,\nNaked for greater shame,\nHe lies, with fetters on each foot,\nWrapt in a sheet of flame!\n\nAnd all the while the burning lime\nEats flesh and bone away,\nIt eats the brittle bone by night,\nAnd the soft flesh by day,\nIt eats the flesh and bone by turns,\nBut it eats the heart alway.\n\n\nFor three long years they will not sow\nOr root or seedling there:\nFor three long years the unblessed spot\nWill sterile be and bare,\nAnd look upon the wondering sky\nWith unreproachful stare.\n\nThey think a murderer's heart would taint\nEach simple seed they sow.\nIt is not true! God's kindly earth\nIs kindlier than men know,\nAnd the red rose would but blow more red,\nThe white rose whiter blow.\n\nOut of his mouth a red, red rose!\nOut of his heart a white!\nFor who can say by what strange way,\nChrist brings His will to light,\nSince the barren staff the pilgrim bore\nBloomed in the great Pope's sight?\n\nBut neither milk-white rose nor red\nMay bloom in prison-air;\nThe shard, the pebble, and the flint,\nAre what they give us there:\nFor flowers have been known to heal\nA common man's despair.\n\nSo never will wine-red rose or white,\nPetal by petal, fall\nOn that stretch of mud and sand that lies\nBy the hideous prison-wall,\nTo tell the men who tramp the yard\nThat God's Son died for all.\n\n\nYet though the hideous prison-wall\nStill hems him round and round,\nAnd a spirit may not walk by night\nThat is with fetters bound,\nAnd a spirit may but weep that lies\nIn such unholy ground,\n\nHe is at peace - this wretched man -\nAt peace, or will be soon:\nThere is no thing to make him mad,\nNor does Terror walk at noon,\nFor the lampless Earth in which he lies\nHas neither Sun nor Moon.\n\nThey hanged him as a beast is hanged:\nThey did not even toll\nA requiem that might have brought\nRest to his startled soul,\nBut hurriedly they took him out,\nAnd hid him in a hole.\n\nThey stripped him of his canvas clothes,\nAnd gave him to the flies:\nThey mocked the swollen purple throat,\nAnd the stark and staring eyes:\nAnd with laughter loud they heaped the shroud\nIn which their convict lies.\n\nThe Chaplain would not kneel to pray\nBy his dishonoured grave:\nNor mark it with that blessed Cross\nThat Christ for sinners gave,\nBecause the man was one of those\nWhom Christ came down to save.\n\nYet all is well; he has but passed\nTo Life's appointed bourne:\nAnd alien tears will fill for him\nPity's long-broken urn,\nFor his mourners will be outcast men,\nAnd outcasts always mourn\n\n\nV\n\n\nI know not whether Laws be right,\nOr whether Laws be wrong;\nAll that we know who lie in gaol\nIs that the wall is strong;\nAnd that each day is like a year,\nA year whose days are long.\n\nBut this I know, that every Law\nThat men have made for Man,\nSince first Man took his brother's life,\nAnd the sad world began,\nBut straws the wheat and saves the chaff\nWith a most evil fan.\n\nThis too I know - and wise it were\nIf each could know the same -\nThat every prison that men build\nIs built with bricks of shame,\nAnd bound with bars lest Christ should see\nHow men their brothers maim.\n\nWith bars they blur the gracious moon,\nAnd blind the goodly sun:\nAnd they do well to hide their Hell,\nFor in it things are done\nThat Son of God nor son of Man\nEver should look upon!\n\n\nThe vilest deeds like poison weeds,\nBloom well in prison-air;\nIt is only what is good in Man\nThat wastes and withers there:\nPale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,\nAnd the Warder is Despair.\n\nFor they starve the little frightened child\nTill it weeps both night and day:\nAnd they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,\nAnd gibe the old and grey,\nAnd some grow mad, and all grow bad,\nAnd none a word may say.\n\nEach narrow cell in which we dwell\nIs a foul and dark latrine,\nAnd the fetid breath of living Death\nChokes up each grated screen,\nAnd all, but Lust, is turned to dust\nIn Humanity's machine.\n\nThe brackish water that we drink\nCreeps with a loathsome slime,\nAnd the bitter bread they weigh in scales\nIs full of chalk and lime,\nAnd Sleep will not lie down, but walks\nWild-eyed, and cries to Time.\n\n\nBut though lean Hunger and green Thirst\nLike asp with adder fight,\nWe have little care of prison fare,\nFor what chills and kills outright\nIs that every stone one lifts by day\nBecomes one's heart by night.\n\nWith midnight always in one's heart,\nAnd twilight in one's cell,\nWe turn the crank, or tear the rope,\nEach in his separate Hell,\nAnd the silence is more awful far\nThan the sound of a brazen bell.\n\nAnd never a human voice comes near\nTo speak a gentle word:\nAnd the eye that watches through the door\nIs pitiless and hard:\nAnd by all forgot, we rot and rot,\nWith soul and body marred.\n\nAnd thus we rust Life's iron chain\nDegraded and alone:\nAnd some men curse, and some men weep,\nAnd some men make no moan:\nBut God's eternal Laws are kind\nAnd break the heart of stone.\n\n\nAnd every human heart that breaks,\nIn prison-cell or yard,\nIs as that broken box that gave\nIts treasure to the Lord,\nAnd filled the unclean leper's house\nWith the scent of costliest nard.\n\nAh! happy they whose hearts can break\nAnd peace of pardon win!\nHow else may man make straight his plan\nAnd cleanse his soul from Sin?\nHow else but through a broken heart\nMay Lord Christ enter in?\n\n\nAnd he of the swollen purple throat,\nAnd the stark and staring eyes,\nWaits for the holy hands that took\nThe Thief to Paradise;\nAnd a broken and a contrite heart\nThe Lord will not despise.\n\nThe man in red who reads the Law\nGave him three weeks of life,\nThree little weeks in which to heal\nHis soul of his soul's strife,\nAnd cleanse from every blot of blood\nThe hand that held the knife.\n\nAnd with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,\nThe hand that held the steel:\nFor only blood can wipe out blood,\nAnd only tears can heal:\nAnd the crimson stain that was of Cain\nBecame Christ's snow-white seal.\n\n\nVI\n\n\nIn Reading gaol by Reading town\nThere is a pit of shame,\nAnd in it lies a wretched man\nEaten by teeth of flame,\nIn a burning winding-sheet he lies,\nAnd his grave has got no name.\n\nAnd there, till Christ call forth the dead,\nIn silence let him lie:\nNo need to waste the foolish tear,\nOr heave the windy sigh:\nThe man had killed the thing he loved,\nAnd so he had to die.\n\nAnd all men kill the thing they love,\nBy all let this be heard,\nSome do it with a bitter look,\nSome with a flattering word,\nThe coward does it with a kiss,\nThe brave man with a sword!"}

{"title":"CHARMIDES","content":"I.\n\nHe was a Grecian lad, who coming home\nWith pulpy figs and wine from Sicily\nStood at his galley's prow, and let the foam\nBlow through his crisp brown curls unconsciously,\nAnd holding wave and wind in boy's despite\nPeered from his dripping seat across the wet and stormy night.\n\nTill with the dawn he saw a burnished spear\nLike a thin thread of gold against the sky,\nAnd hoisted sail, and strained the creaking gear,\nAnd bade the pilot head her lustily\nAgainst the nor'west gale, and all day long\nHeld on his way, and marked the rowers' time with measured song.\n\nAnd when the faint Corinthian hills were red\nDropped anchor in a little sandy bay,\nAnd with fresh boughs of olive crowned his head,\nAnd brushed from cheek and throat the hoary spray,\nAnd washed his limbs with oil, and from the hold\nBrought out his linen tunic and his sandals brazen-soled,\n\nAnd a rich robe stained with the fishers' juice\nWhich of some swarthy trader he had bought\nUpon the sunny quay at Syracuse,\nAnd was with Tyrian broideries inwrought,\nAnd by the questioning merchants made his way\nUp through the soft and silver woods, and when the labouring day\n\nHad spun its tangled web of crimson cloud,\nClomb the high hill, and with swift silent feet\nCrept to the fane unnoticed by the crowd\nOf busy priests, and from some dark retreat\nWatched the young swains his frolic playmates bring\nThe firstling of their little flock, and the shy shepherd fling\n\nThe crackling salt upon the flame, or hang\nHis studded crook against the temple wall\nTo Her who keeps away the ravenous fang\nOf the base wolf from homestead and from stall;\nAnd then the clear-voiced maidens 'gan to sing,\nAnd to the altar each man brought some goodly offering,\n\nA beechen cup brimming with milky foam,\nA fair cloth wrought with cunning imagery\nOf hounds in chase, a waxen honey-comb\nDripping with oozy gold which scarce the bee\nHad ceased from building, a black skin of oil\nMeet for the wrestlers, a great boar the fierce and white-tusked\nspoil\n\nStolen from Artemis that jealous maid\nTo please Athena, and the dappled hide\nOf a tall stag who in some mountain glade\nHad met the shaft; and then the herald cried,\nAnd from the pillared precinct one by one\nWent the glad Greeks well pleased that they their simple vows had\ndone.\n\nAnd the old priest put out the waning fires\nSave that one lamp whose restless ruby glowed\nFor ever in the cell, and the shrill lyres\nCame fainter on the wind, as down the road\nIn joyous dance these country folk did pass,\nAnd with stout hands the warder closed the gates of polished brass.\n\nLong time he lay and hardly dared to breathe,\nAnd heard the cadenced drip of spilt-out wine,\nAnd the rose-petals falling from the wreath\nAs the night breezes wandered through the shrine,\nAnd seemed to be in some entranced swoon\nTill through the open roof above the full and brimming moon\n\nFlooded with sheeny waves the marble floor,\nWhen from his nook up leapt the venturous lad,\nAnd flinging wide the cedar-carven door\nBeheld an awful image saffron-clad\nAnd armed for battle! the gaunt Griffin glared\nFrom the huge helm, and the long lance of wreck and ruin flared\n\nLike a red rod of flame, stony and steeled\nThe Gorgon's head its leaden eyeballs rolled,\nAnd writhed its snaky horrors through the shield,\nAnd gaped aghast with bloodless lips and cold\nIn passion impotent, while with blind gaze\nThe blinking owl between the feet hooted in shrill amaze.\n\nThe lonely fisher as he trimmed his lamp\nFar out at sea off Sunium, or cast\nThe net for tunnies, heard a brazen tramp\nOf horses smite the waves, and a wild blast\nDivide the folded curtains of the night,\nAnd knelt upon the little poop, and prayed in holy fright.\n\nAnd guilty lovers in their venery\nForgat a little while their stolen sweets,\nDeeming they heard dread Dian's bitter cry;\nAnd the grim watchmen on their lofty seats\nRan to their shields in haste precipitate,\nOr strained black-bearded throats across the dusky parapet.\n\nFor round the temple rolled the clang of arms,\nAnd the twelve Gods leapt up in marble fear,\nAnd the air quaked with dissonant alarums\nTill huge Poseidon shook his mighty spear,\nAnd on the frieze the prancing horses neighed,\nAnd the low tread of hurrying feet rang from the cavalcade.\n\nReady for death with parted lips he stood,\nAnd well content at such a price to see\nThat calm wide brow, that terrible maidenhood,\nThe marvel of that pitiless chastity,\nAh! well content indeed, for never wight\nSince Troy's young shepherd prince had seen so wonderful a sight.\n\nReady for death he stood, but lo! the air\nGrew silent, and the horses ceased to neigh,\nAnd off his brow he tossed the clustering hair,\nAnd from his limbs he throw the cloak away;\nFor whom would not such love make desperate?\nAnd nigher came, and touched her throat, and with hands violate\n\nUndid the cuirass, and the crocus gown,\nAnd bared the breasts of polished ivory,\nTill from the waist the peplos falling down\nLeft visible the secret mystery\nWhich to no lover will Athena show,\nThe grand cool flanks, the crescent thighs, the bossy hills of\nsnow.\n\nThose who have never known a lover's sin\nLet them not read my ditty, it will be\nTo their dull ears so musicless and thin\nThat they will have no joy of it, but ye\nTo whose wan cheeks now creeps the lingering smile,\nYe who have learned who Eros is, - O listen yet awhile.\n\nA little space he let his greedy eyes\nRest on the burnished image, till mere sight\nHalf swooned for surfeit of such luxuries,\nAnd then his lips in hungering delight\nFed on her lips, and round the towered neck\nHe flung his arms, nor cared at all his passion's will to check.\n\nNever I ween did lover hold such tryst,\nFor all night long he murmured honeyed word,\nAnd saw her sweet unravished limbs, and kissed\nHer pale and argent body undisturbed,\nAnd paddled with the polished throat, and pressed\nHis hot and beating heart upon her chill and icy breast.\n\nIt was as if Numidian javelins\nPierced through and through his wild and whirling brain,\nAnd his nerves thrilled like throbbing violins\nIn exquisite pulsation, and the pain\nWas such sweet anguish that he never drew\nHis lips from hers till overhead the lark of warning flew.\n\nThey who have never seen the daylight peer\nInto a darkened room, and drawn the curtain,\nAnd with dull eyes and wearied from some dear\nAnd worshipped body risen, they for certain\nWill never know of what I try to sing,\nHow long the last kiss was, how fond and late his lingering.\n\nThe moon was girdled with a crystal rim,\nThe sign which shipmen say is ominous\nOf wrath in heaven, the wan stars were dim,\nAnd the low lightening east was tremulous\nWith the faint fluttering wings of flying dawn,\nEre from the silent sombre shrine his lover had withdrawn.\n\nDown the steep rock with hurried feet and fast\nClomb the brave lad, and reached the cave of Pan,\nAnd heard the goat-foot snoring as he passed,\nAnd leapt upon a grassy knoll and ran\nLike a young fawn unto an olive wood\nWhich in a shady valley by the well-built city stood;\n\nAnd sought a little stream, which well he knew,\nFor oftentimes with boyish careless shout\nThe green and crested grebe he would pursue,\nOr snare in woven net the silver trout,\nAnd down amid the startled reeds he lay\nPanting in breathless sweet affright, and waited for the day.\n\nOn the green bank he lay, and let one hand\nDip in the cool dark eddies listlessly,\nAnd soon the breath of morning came and fanned\nHis hot flushed cheeks, or lifted wantonly\nThe tangled curls from off his forehead, while\nHe on the running water gazed with strange and secret smile.\n\nAnd soon the shepherd in rough woollen cloak\nWith his long crook undid the wattled cotes,\nAnd from the stack a thin blue wreath of smoke\nCurled through the air across the ripening oats,\nAnd on the hill the yellow house-dog bayed\nAs through the crisp and rustling fern the heavy cattle strayed.\n\nAnd when the light-foot mower went afield\nAcross the meadows laced with threaded dew,\nAnd the sheep bleated on the misty weald,\nAnd from its nest the waking corncrake flew,\nSome woodmen saw him lying by the stream\nAnd marvelled much that any lad so beautiful could seem,\n\nNor deemed him born of mortals, and one said,\n'It is young Hylas, that false runaway\nWho with a Naiad now would make his bed\nForgetting Herakles,' but others, 'Nay,\nIt is Narcissus, his own paramour,\nThose are the fond and crimson lips no woman can allure.'\n\nAnd when they nearer came a third one cried,\n'It is young Dionysos who has hid\nHis spear and fawnskin by the river side\nWeary of hunting with the Bassarid,\nAnd wise indeed were we away to fly:\nThey live not long who on the gods immortal come to spy.'\n\nSo turned they back, and feared to look behind,\nAnd told the timid swain how they had seen\nAmid the reeds some woodland god reclined,\nAnd no man dared to cross the open green,\nAnd on that day no olive-tree was slain,\nNor rushes cut, but all deserted was the fair domain,\n\nSave when the neat-herd's lad, his empty pail\nWell slung upon his back, with leap and bound\nRaced on the other side, and stopped to hail,\nHoping that he some comrade new had found,\nAnd gat no answer, and then half afraid\nPassed on his simple way, or down the still and silent glade\n\nA little girl ran laughing from the farm,\nNot thinking of love's secret mysteries,\nAnd when she saw the white and gleaming arm\nAnd all his manlihood, with longing eyes\nWhose passion mocked her sweet virginity\nWatched him awhile, and then stole back sadly and wearily.\n\nFar off he heard the city's hum and noise,\nAnd now and then the shriller laughter where\nThe passionate purity of brown-limbed boys\nWrestled or raced in the clear healthful air,\nAnd now and then a little tinkling bell\nAs the shorn wether led the sheep down to the mossy well.\n\nThrough the grey willows danced the fretful gnat,\nThe grasshopper chirped idly from the tree,\nIn sleek and oily coat the water-rat\nBreasting the little ripples manfully\nMade for the wild-duck's nest, from bough to bough\nHopped the shy finch, and the huge tortoise crept across the\nslough.\n\nOn the faint wind floated the silky seeds\nAs the bright scythe swept through the waving grass,\nThe ouzel-cock splashed circles in the reeds\nAnd flecked with silver whorls the forest's glass,\nWhich scarce had caught again its imagery\nEre from its bed the dusky tench leapt at the dragon-fly.\n\nBut little care had he for any thing\nThough up and down the beech the squirrel played,\nAnd from the copse the linnet 'gan to sing\nTo its brown mate its sweetest serenade;\nAh! little care indeed, for he had seen\nThe breasts of Pallas and the naked wonder of the Queen.\n\nBut when the herdsman called his straggling goats\nWith whistling pipe across the rocky road,\nAnd the shard-beetle with its trumpet-notes\nBoomed through the darkening woods, and seemed to bode\nOf coming storm, and the belated crane\nPassed homeward like a shadow, and the dull big drops of rain\n\nFell on the pattering fig-leaves, up he rose,\nAnd from the gloomy forest went his way\nPast sombre homestead and wet orchard-close,\nAnd came at last unto a little quay,\nAnd called his mates aboard, and took his seat\nOn the high poop, and pushed from land, and loosed the dripping\nsheet,\n\nAnd steered across the bay, and when nine suns\nPassed down the long and laddered way of gold,\nAnd nine pale moons had breathed their orisons\nTo the chaste stars their confessors, or told\nTheir dearest secret to the downy moth\nThat will not fly at noonday, through the foam and surging froth\n\nCame a great owl with yellow sulphurous eyes\nAnd lit upon the ship, whose timbers creaked\nAs though the lading of three argosies\nWere in the hold, and flapped its wings and shrieked,\nAnd darkness straightway stole across the deep,\nSheathed was Orion's sword, dread Mars himself fled down the steep,\n\nAnd the moon hid behind a tawny mask\nOf drifting cloud, and from the ocean's marge\nRose the red plume, the huge and horned casque,\nThe seven-cubit spear, the brazen targe!\nAnd clad in bright and burnished panoply\nAthena strode across the stretch of sick and shivering sea!\n\nTo the dull sailors' sight her loosened looks\nSeemed like the jagged storm-rack, and her feet\nOnly the spume that floats on hidden rocks,\nAnd, marking how the rising waters beat\nAgainst the rolling ship, the pilot cried\nTo the young helmsman at the stern to luff to windward side\n\nBut he, the overbold adulterer,\nA dear profaner of great mysteries,\nAn ardent amorous idolater,\nWhen he beheld those grand relentless eyes\nLaughed loud for joy, and crying out 'I come'\nLeapt from the lofty poop into the chill and churning foam.\n\nThen fell from the high heaven one bright star,\nOne dancer left the circling galaxy,\nAnd back to Athens on her clattering car\nIn all the pride of venged divinity\nPale Pallas swept with shrill and steely clank,\nAnd a few gurgling bubbles rose where her boy lover sank.\n\nAnd the mast shuddered as the gaunt owl flew\nWith mocking hoots after the wrathful Queen,\nAnd the old pilot bade the trembling crew\nHoist the big sail, and told how he had seen\nClose to the stern a dim and giant form,\nAnd like a dipping swallow the stout ship dashed through the storm.\n\nAnd no man dared to speak of Charmides\nDeeming that he some evil thing had wrought,\nAnd when they reached the strait Symplegades\nThey beached their galley on the shore, and sought\nThe toll-gate of the city hastily,\nAnd in the market showed their brown and pictured pottery.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nBut some good Triton-god had ruth, and bare\nThe boy's drowned body back to Grecian land,\nAnd mermaids combed his dank and dripping hair\nAnd smoothed his brow, and loosed his clenching hand;\nSome brought sweet spices from far Araby,\nAnd others bade the halcyon sing her softest lullaby.\n\nAnd when he neared his old Athenian home,\nA mighty billow rose up suddenly\nUpon whose oily back the clotted foam\nLay diapered in some strange fantasy,\nAnd clasping him unto its glassy breast\nSwept landward, like a white-maned steed upon a venturous quest!\n\nNow where Colonos leans unto the sea\nThere lies a long and level stretch of lawn;\nThe rabbit knows it, and the mountain bee\nFor it deserts Hymettus, and the Faun\nIs not afraid, for never through the day\nComes a cry ruder than the shout of shepherd lads at play.\n\nBut often from the thorny labyrinth\nAnd tangled branches of the circling wood\nThe stealthy hunter sees young Hyacinth\nHurling the polished disk, and draws his hood\nOver his guilty gaze, and creeps away,\nNor dares to wind his horn, or - else at the first break of day\n\nThe Dryads come and throw the leathern ball\nAlong the reedy shore, and circumvent\nSome goat-eared Pan to be their seneschal\nFor fear of bold Poseidon's ravishment,\nAnd loose their girdles, with shy timorous eyes,\nLest from the surf his azure arms and purple beard should rise.\n\nOn this side and on that a rocky cave,\nHung with the yellow-belled laburnum, stands\nSmooth is the beach, save where some ebbing wave\nLeaves its faint outline etched upon the sands,\nAs though it feared to be too soon forgot\nBy the green rush, its playfellow, - and yet, it is a spot\n\nSo small, that the inconstant butterfly\nCould steal the hoarded money from each flower\nEre it was noon, and still not satisfy\nIts over-greedy love, - within an hour\nA sailor boy, were he but rude enow\nTo land and pluck a garland for his galley's painted prow,\n\nWould almost leave the little meadow bare,\nFor it knows nothing of great pageantry,\nOnly a few narcissi here and there\nStand separate in sweet austerity,\nDotting the unmown grass with silver stars,\nAnd here and there a daffodil waves tiny scimitars.\n\nHither the billow brought him, and was glad\nOf such dear servitude, and where the land\nWas virgin of all waters laid the lad\nUpon the golden margent of the strand,\nAnd like a lingering lover oft returned\nTo kiss those pallid limbs which once with intense fire burned,\n\nEre the wet seas had quenched that holocaust,\nThat self-fed flame, that passionate lustihead,\nEre grisly death with chill and nipping frost\nHad withered up those lilies white and red\nWhich, while the boy would through the forest range,\nAnswered each other in a sweet antiphonal counter-change.\n\nAnd when at dawn the wood-nymphs, hand-in-hand,\nThreaded the bosky dell, their satyr spied\nThe boy's pale body stretched upon the sand,\nAnd feared Poseidon's treachery, and cried,\nAnd like bright sunbeams flitting through a glade\nEach startled Dryad sought some safe and leafy ambuscade.\n\nSave one white girl, who deemed it would not be\nSo dread a thing to feel a sea-god's arms\nCrushing her breasts in amorous tyranny,\nAnd longed to listen to those subtle charms\nInsidious lovers weave when they would win\nSome fenced fortress, and stole back again, nor thought it sin\n\nTo yield her treasure unto one so fair,\nAnd lay beside him, thirsty with love's drouth,\nCalled him soft names, played with his tangled hair,\nAnd with hot lips made havoc of his mouth\nAfraid he might not wake, and then afraid\nLest he might wake too soon, fled back, and then, fond renegade,\n\nReturned to fresh assault, and all day long\nSat at his side, and laughed at her new toy,\nAnd held his hand, and sang her sweetest song,\nThen frowned to see how froward was the boy\nWho would not with her maidenhood entwine,\nNor knew that three days since his eyes had looked on Proserpine;\n\nNor knew what sacrilege his lips had done,\nBut said, 'He will awake, I know him well,\nHe will awake at evening when the sun\nHangs his red shield on Corinth's citadel;\nThis sleep is but a cruel treachery\nTo make me love him more, and in some cavern of the sea\n\nDeeper than ever falls the fisher's line\nAlready a huge Triton blows his horn,\nAnd weaves a garland from the crystalline\nAnd drifting ocean-tendrils to adorn\nThe emerald pillars of our bridal bed,\nFor sphered in foaming silver, and with coral crowned head,\n\nWe two will sit upon a throne of pearl,\nAnd a blue wave will be our canopy,\nAnd at our feet the water-snakes will curl\nIn all their amethystine panoply\nOf diamonded mail, and we will mark\nThe mullets swimming by the mast of some storm-foundered bark,\n\nVermilion-finned with eyes of bossy gold\nLike flakes of crimson light, and the great deep\nHis glassy-portaled chamber will unfold,\nAnd we will see the painted dolphins sleep\nCradled by murmuring halcyons on the rocks\nWhere Proteus in quaint suit of green pastures his monstrous\nflocks.\n\nAnd tremulous opal-hued anemones\nWill wave their purple fringes where we tread\nUpon the mirrored floor, and argosies\nOf fishes flecked with tawny scales will thread\nThe drifting cordage of the shattered wreck,\nAnd honey-coloured amber beads our twining limbs will deck.'\n\nBut when that baffled Lord of War the Sun\nWith gaudy pennon flying passed away\nInto his brazen House, and one by one\nThe little yellow stars began to stray\nAcross the field of heaven, ah! then indeed\nShe feared his lips upon her lips would never care to feed,\n\nAnd cried, 'Awake, already the pale moon\nWashes the trees with silver, and the wave\nCreeps grey and chilly up this sandy dune,\nThe croaking frogs are out, and from the cave\nThe nightjar shrieks, the fluttering bats repass,\nAnd the brown stoat with hollow flanks creeps through the dusky\ngrass.\n\nNay, though thou art a god, be not so coy,\nFor in yon stream there is a little reed\nThat often whispers how a lovely boy\nLay with her once upon a grassy mead,\nWho when his cruel pleasure he had done\nSpread wings of rustling gold and soared aloft into the sun.\n\nBe not so coy, the laurel trembles still\nWith great Apollo's kisses, and the fir\nWhose clustering sisters fringe the seaward hill\nHath many a tale of that bold ravisher\nWhom men call Boreas, and I have seen\nThe mocking eyes of Hermes through the poplar's silvery sheen.\n\nEven the jealous Naiads call me fair,\nAnd every morn a young and ruddy swain\nWoos me with apples and with locks of hair,\nAnd seeks to soothe my virginal disdain\nBy all the gifts the gentle wood-nymphs love;\nBut yesterday he brought to me an iris-plumaged dove\n\nWith little crimson feet, which with its store\nOf seven spotted eggs the cruel lad\nHad stolen from the lofty sycamore\nAt daybreak, when her amorous comrade had\nFlown off in search of berried juniper\nWhich most they love; the fretful wasp, that earliest vintager\n\nOf the blue grapes, hath not persistency\nSo constant as this simple shepherd-boy\nFor my poor lips, his joyous purity\nAnd laughing sunny eyes might well decoy\nA Dryad from her oath to Artemis;\nFor very beautiful is he, his mouth was made to kiss;\n\nHis argent forehead, like a rising moon\nOver the dusky hills of meeting brows,\nIs crescent shaped, the hot and Tyrian noon\nLeads from the myrtle-grove no goodlier spouse\nFor Cytheraea, the first silky down\nFringes his blushing cheeks, and his young limbs are strong and\nbrown;\n\nAnd he is rich, and fat and fleecy herds\nOf bleating sheep upon his meadows lie,\nAnd many an earthen bowl of yellow curds\nIs in his homestead for the thievish fly\nTo swim and drown in, the pink clover mead\nKeeps its sweet store for him, and he can pipe on oaten reed.\n\nAnd yet I love him not; it was for thee\nI kept my love; I knew that thou would'st come\nTo rid me of this pallid chastity,\nThou fairest flower of the flowerless foam\nOf all the wide AEgean, brightest star\nOf ocean's azure heavens where the mirrored planets are!\n\nI knew that thou would'st come, for when at first\nThe dry wood burgeoned, and the sap of spring\nSwelled in my green and tender bark or burst\nTo myriad multitudinous blossoming\nWhich mocked the midnight with its mimic moons\nThat did not dread the dawn, and first the thrushes' rapturous\ntunes\n\nStartled the squirrel from its granary,\nAnd cuckoo flowers fringed the narrow lane,\nThrough my young leaves a sensuous ecstasy\nCrept like new wine, and every mossy vein\nThrobbed with the fitful pulse of amorous blood,\nAnd the wild winds of passion shook my slim stem's maidenhood.\n\nThe trooping fawns at evening came and laid\nTheir cool black noses on my lowest boughs,\nAnd on my topmost branch the blackbird made\nA little nest of grasses for his spouse,\nAnd now and then a twittering wren would light\nOn a thin twig which hardly bare the weight of such delight.\n\nI was the Attic shepherd's trysting place,\nBeneath my shadow Amaryllis lay,\nAnd round my trunk would laughing Daphnis chase\nThe timorous girl, till tired out with play\nShe felt his hot breath stir her tangled hair,\nAnd turned, and looked, and fled no more from such delightful\nsnare.\n\nThen come away unto my ambuscade\nWhere clustering woodbine weaves a canopy\nFor amorous pleasaunce, and the rustling shade\nOf Paphian myrtles seems to sanctify\nThe dearest rites of love; there in the cool\nAnd green recesses of its farthest depth there is pool,\n\nThe ouzel's haunt, the wild bee's pasturage,\nFor round its rim great creamy lilies float\nThrough their flat leaves in verdant anchorage,\nEach cup a white-sailed golden-laden boat\nSteered by a dragon-fly, - be not afraid\nTo leave this wan and wave-kissed shore, surely the place was made\n\nFor lovers such as we; the Cyprian Queen,\nOne arm around her boyish paramour,\nStrays often there at eve, and I have seen\nThe moon strip off her misty vestiture\nFor young Endymion's eyes; be not afraid,\nThe panther feet of Dian never tread that secret glade.\n\nNay if thou will'st, back to the beating brine,\nBack to the boisterous billow let us go,\nAnd walk all day beneath the hyaline\nHuge vault of Neptune's watery portico,\nAnd watch the purple monsters of the deep\nSport in ungainly play, and from his lair keen Xiphias leap.\n\nFor if my mistress find me lying here\nShe will not ruth or gentle pity show,\nBut lay her boar-spear down, and with austere\nRelentless fingers string the cornel bow,\nAnd draw the feathered notch against her breast,\nAnd loose the arched cord; aye, even now upon the quest\n\nI hear her hurrying feet, - awake, awake,\nThou laggard in love's battle! once at least\nLet me drink deep of passion's wine, and slake\nMy parched being with the nectarous feast\nWhich even gods affect! O come, Love, come,\nStill we have time to reach the cavern of thine azure home.'\n\nScarce had she spoken when the shuddering trees\nShook, and the leaves divided, and the air\nGrew conscious of a god, and the grey seas\nCrawled backward, and a long and dismal blare\nBlew from some tasselled horn, a sleuth-hound bayed,\nAnd like a flame a barbed reed flew whizzing down the glade.\n\nAnd where the little flowers of her breast\nJust brake into their milky blossoming,\nThis murderous paramour, this unbidden guest,\nPierced and struck deep in horrid chambering,\nAnd ploughed a bloody furrow with its dart,\nAnd dug a long red road, and cleft with winged death her heart.\n\nSobbing her life out with a bitter cry\nOn the boy's body fell the Dryad maid,\nSobbing for incomplete virginity,\nAnd raptures unenjoyed, and pleasures dead,\nAnd all the pain of things unsatisfied,\nAnd the bright drops of crimson youth crept down her throbbing\nside.\n\nAh! pitiful it was to hear her moan,\nAnd very pitiful to see her die\nEre she had yielded up her sweets, or known\nThe joy of passion, that dread mystery\nWhich not to know is not to live at all,\nAnd yet to know is to be held in death's most deadly thrall.\n\nBut as it hapt the Queen of Cythere,\nWho with Adonis all night long had lain\nWithin some shepherd's hut in Arcady,\nOn team of silver doves and gilded wain\nWas journeying Paphos-ward, high up afar\nFrom mortal ken between the mountains and the morning star,\n\nAnd when low down she spied the hapless pair,\nAnd heard the Oread's faint despairing cry,\nWhose cadence seemed to play upon the air\nAs though it were a viol, hastily\nShe bade her pigeons fold each straining plume,\nAnd dropt to earth, and reached the strand, and saw their dolorous\ndoom.\n\nFor as a gardener turning back his head\nTo catch the last notes of the linnet, mows\nWith careless scythe too near some flower bed,\nAnd cuts the thorny pillar of the rose,\nAnd with the flower's loosened loneliness\nStrews the brown mould; or as some shepherd lad in wantonness\n\nDriving his little flock along the mead\nTreads down two daffodils, which side by aide\nHave lured the lady-bird with yellow brede\nAnd made the gaudy moth forget its pride,\nTreads down their brimming golden chalices\nUnder light feet which were not made for such rude ravages;\n\nOr as a schoolboy tired of his book\nFlings himself down upon the reedy grass\nAnd plucks two water-lilies from the brook,\nAnd for a time forgets the hour glass,\nThen wearies of their sweets, and goes his way,\nAnd lets the hot sun kill them, even go these lovers lay.\n\nAnd Venus cried, 'It is dread Artemis\nWhose bitter hand hath wrought this cruelty,\nOr else that mightier maid whose care it is\nTo guard her strong and stainless majesty\nUpon the hill Athenian, - alas!\nThat they who loved so well unloved into Death's house should\npass.'\n\nSo with soft hands she laid the boy and girl\nIn the great golden waggon tenderly\n(Her white throat whiter than a moony pearl\nJust threaded with a blue vein's tapestry\nHad not yet ceased to throb, and still her breast\nSwayed like a wind-stirred lily in ambiguous unrest)\n\nAnd then each pigeon spread its milky van,\nThe bright car soared into the dawning sky,\nAnd like a cloud the aerial caravan\nPassed over the AEgean silently,\nTill the faint air was troubled with the song\nFrom the wan mouths that call on bleeding Thammuz all night long.\n\nBut when the doves had reached their wonted goal\nWhere the wide stair of orbed marble dips\nIts snows into the sea, her fluttering soul\nJust shook the trembling petals of her lips\nAnd passed into the void, and Venus knew\nThat one fair maid the less would walk amid her retinue,\n\nAnd bade her servants carve a cedar chest\nWith all the wonder of this history,\nWithin whose scented womb their limbs should rest\nWhere olive-trees make tender the blue sky\nOn the low hills of Paphos, and the Faun\nPipes in the noonday, and the nightingale sings on till dawn.\n\nNor failed they to obey her hest, and ere\nThe morning bee had stung the daffodil\nWith tiny fretful spear, or from its lair\nThe waking stag had leapt across the rill\nAnd roused the ouzel, or the lizard crept\nAthwart the sunny rock, beneath the grass their bodies slept.\n\nAnd when day brake, within that silver shrine\nFed by the flames of cressets tremulous,\nQueen Venus knelt and prayed to Proserpine\nThat she whose beauty made Death amorous\nShould beg a guerdon from her pallid Lord,\nAnd let Desire pass across dread Charon's icy ford.\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIn melancholy moonless Acheron,\nFarm for the goodly earth and joyous day\nWhere no spring ever buds, nor ripening sun\nWeighs down the apple trees, nor flowery May\nChequers with chestnut blooms the grassy floor,\nWhere thrushes never sing, and piping linnets mate no more,\n\nThere by a dim and dark Lethaean well\nYoung Charmides was lying; wearily\nHe plucked the blossoms from the asphodel,\nAnd with its little rifled treasury\nStrewed the dull waters of the dusky stream,\nAnd watched the white stars founder, and the land was like a dream,\n\nWhen as he gazed into the watery glass\nAnd through his brown hair's curly tangles scanned\nHis own wan face, a shadow seemed to pass\nAcross the mirror, and a little hand\nStole into his, and warm lips timidly\nBrushed his pale cheeks, and breathed their secret forth into a\nsigh.\n\nThen turned he round his weary eyes and saw,\nAnd ever nigher still their faces came,\nAnd nigher ever did their young mouths draw\nUntil they seemed one perfect rose of flame,\nAnd longing arms around her neck he cast,\nAnd felt her throbbing bosom, and his breath came hot and fast,\n\nAnd all his hoarded sweets were hers to kiss,\nAnd all her maidenhood was his to slay,\nAnd limb to limb in long and rapturous bliss\nTheir passion waxed and waned, - O why essay\nTo pipe again of love, too venturous reed!\nEnough, enough that Eros laughed upon that flowerless mead.\n\nToo venturous poesy, O why essay\nTo pipe again of passion! fold thy wings\nO'er daring Icarus and bid thy lay\nSleep hidden in the lyre's silent strings\nTill thou hast found the old Castalian rill,\nOr from the Lesbian waters plucked drowned Sappho's golden quid!\n\nEnough, enough that he whose life had been\nA fiery pulse of sin, a splendid shame,\nCould in the loveless land of Hades glean\nOne scorching harvest from those fields of flame\nWhere passion walks with naked unshod feet\nAnd is not wounded, - ah! enough that once their lips could meet\n\nIn that wild throb when all existences\nSeemed narrowed to one single ecstasy\nWhich dies through its own sweetness and the stress\nOf too much pleasure, ere Persephone\nHad bade them serve her by the ebon throne\nOf the pale God who in the fields of Enna loosed her zone."}

{"title":"Sedge-Warblers","content":"THIS beauty made me dream there was a time\nLong past and irrecoverable, a clime\nWhere any brook so radiant racing clear\nThrough buttercup and kingcup bright as brass\nBut gentle, nourishing the meadow grass\nThat leans and scurries in the wind, would bear\nAnother beauty, divine and feminine,\nChild to the sun, a nymph whose soul unstained\nCould love all day, and never hate or tire,\nA lover of mortal or immortal kin.\n\nAnd yet, rid of this dream, ere I had drained\nIts poison, quieted was my desire\nSo that I only looked into the water,\nClearer than any goddess or man's daughter,\nAnd hearkened while it combed the dark green hair\nAnd shook the millions of the blossoms white\nOf water-crowfoot, and curdled to one sheet\nThe flowers fallen from the chestnuts in the park\nFar off. And sedge-warblers, clinging so light\nTo willow twigs, sang longer than the lark,\nQuick, shrill, or grating, a song to match the heat\nOf the strong sun, nor less the water's cool,\nGushing through narrows, swirling in the pool.\nTheir song that lacks all words, all melody,\nAll sweetness almost, was dearer then to me\nThan sweetest voice that sings in tune sweet words.\nThis was the best of May--the small brown birds\nWisely reiterating endlessly\nWhat no man learnt yet, in or out of school."}

{"title":"The Unknown Bird","content":"THREE lovely notes he whistled, too soft to be\n    heard\nIf others sang; but others never sang\nIn the great beech-wood all that May and June.\nNo one saw him: I alone could hear him\nThough many listened. Was it but four years\nAgo? or five? He never came again.\n\nOftenest when I heard him I was alone,\nNor could I ever make another hear.\nLa-la-la! he called, seeming far-off--\nAs if a cock crowed past the edge of the world,\nAs if the bird or I were in a dream.\nYet that he travelled through the trees and some-\n    times\nNeared me, was plain, though somehow distant\n    still\nHe sounded. All the proof is--I told men\nWhat I had heard.\n\n            I never knew a voice,\nMan, beast, or bird, better than this. I told\nThe naturalists; but neither had they heard\nAnything like the notes that did so haunt me,\nI had them clear by heart and have them still.\nFour years, or five, have made no difference.\n    Then\nAs now that La-la-la! was bodiless sweet:\nSad more than joyful it was, if I must say\nThat it was one or other, but if sad\n'Twas sad only with joy too, too far off\nFor me to taste it. But I cannot tell\nIf truly never anything but fair\nThe days were when he sang, as now they seem.\nThis surely I know, that I who listened then,\nHappy sometimes, sometimes suffering\nA heavy body and a heavy heart,\nNow straightway, if I think of it, become\nLight as that bird wandering beyond my shore."}

{"title":"Parting","content":"THE Past is a strange land, most strange.\nWind blows not there, nor does rain fall:\nIf they do, they cannot hurt at all.\nMen of all kinds as equals range\n\nThe soundless fields and streets of it.\nPleasure and pain there have no sting,\nThe perished self not suffering\nThat lacks all blood and nerve and wit,\n\nAnd is in shadow-land a shade.\nRemembered joy and misery\nBring joy to the joyous equally;\nBoth sadden the sad. So memory made\n\nParting to-day a double pain:\nFirst because it was parting; next\nBecause the ill it ended vexed\nAnd mocked me from the Past again,\n\nNot as what had been remedied\nHad I gone on,--not that, oh no!\nBut as itself no longer woe;\nSighs, angry word and look and deed\n\nBeing faded: rather a kind of bliss,\nFor there spiritualized it lay\nIn the perpetual yesterday\nThat naught can stir or stain like this."}

{"title":"Ambition","content":"UNLESS it was that day I never knew\nAmbition.

The steep farm roof,\nWith tiles duskily glowing, entertained\nThe mid-day sun; and up and down the roof\nWhite pigeons nestled. There was no sound but one.\nThree cart-horses were looking over a gate\nDrowsily through their forelocks, swishing their tails\nAgainst a fly, a solitary fly.\n\nThe Winter's cheek flushed as if he had drained\nSpring, Summer, and Autumn at a draught\nAnd smiled quietly. But 'twas not Winter--\nRather a season of bliss unchangeable\nAwakened from farm and church where it had lain\nSafe under tile and thatch for ages since\nThis England, Old already, was called Merry."}
{"title":"Swedes","content":"THEY have taken the gable from the roof of clay\nOn the long swede pile. They have let in the sun\nTo the white and gold and purple of curled fronds\nUnsunned. It is a sight more tender-gorgeous\nAt the wood-corner where Winter moans and drips\nThan when, in the Valley of the Tombs of Kings,\nA boy crawls down into a Pharaoh's tomb\nAnd, first of Christian men, beholds the mummy,\nGod and monkey, chariot and throne and vase,\nBlue pottery, alabaster, and gold.\n\nBut dreamless long-dead Amen-hotep lies.\nThis is a dream of Winter, sweet as Spring."}
{"title":"As the Team's Head-Brass","content":"As the team's head-brass flashed out on the turn\nThe lovers disappeared into the wood.\nI sat among the boughs of the fallen elm\nThat strewed an angle of the fallow, and\nWatched the plough narrowing a yellow square\nOf charlock. Every time the horses turned\nInstead of treading me down, the ploughman leaned\nUpon the handles to say or ask a word,\nAbout the weather, next about the war.\nScraping the share he faced towards the wood,\nAnd screwed along the furrow till the brass flashed\nOnce more.\n\n               The blizzard felled the elm whose crest\nI sat in, by a woodpecker's round hole,\nThe ploughman said. \"When will they take it away?\"\n\"When the war's over.\" So the talk began--\nOne minute and an interval of ten,\nA minute more and the same interval.\n\"Have you been out?\" \"No.\" \"And don't want\nto, perhaps?\"\n\"If I could only come back again, I should.\nI could spare an arm. I shouldn't want to lose\nA leg. If I should lose my head, why, so,\nI should want nothing more. . . . Have many gone\nFrom here?\" \"Yes.\" \"Many lost?\" \"Yes:\n   good few.\nOnly two teams work on the farm this year.\nOne of my mates is dead. The second day\nIn France they killed him. It was back in March,\nThe very night of the blizzard, too. Now if\nHe had stayed here we should have moved the tree.\"\n\"And I should not have sat here. Everything\nWould have been different. For it would have been\nAnother world.\" \"Ay, and a better, though\nIf we could see all all might seem good.\" Then\nThe lovers came out of the wood again:\nThe horses started and for the last time\nI watched the clods crumble and topple over\nAfter the ploughshare and the stumbling team."}

{"title":"Like the Touch of Rain","content":"LIKE the touch of rain she was\nOn a man's flesh and hair and eyes\nWhen the joy of walking thus\nHas taken him by surprise:\n\nWith the love of the storm he burns,\nHe sings, he laughs, well I know how,\nBut forgets when he returns\nAs I shall not forget her \"Go now.\"\n\nThose two words shut a door\nBetween me and the blessed rain\nThat was never shut before\nAnd will not open again."}
{"title":"The Path","content":"RUNNING along a bank, a parapet\nThat saves from the precipitous wood below\nThe level road, there is a path. It serves\nChildren for looking down the long smooth steep,\nBetween the legs of beech and yew, to where\nA fallen tree checks the sight: while men and women\nContent themselves with the road and what they see\nOver the bank, and what the children tell.\nThe path, winding like silver, trickles on,\nBordered and even invaded by thinnest moss\nThat tries to cover roots and crumbling chalk\nWith gold, olive, and emerald, but in vain.\nThe children wear it. They have flattened the bank\nOn top, and silvered it between the moss\nWith the current of their feet, year after year.\nBut the road is houseless, and leads not to school.\nTo see a child is rare there, and the eye\nHas but the road, the wood that overhangs\nAnd underyawns it, and the path that looks\nAs if it led on to some legendary\nOr fancied place where men have wished to go\nAnd stay; till, sudden, it ends where the wood ends."}
{"title":"The Combe","content":"THE Combe was ever dark, ancient and dark.\nIts mouth is stopped with bramble, thorn, and briar;\nAnd no one scrambles over the sliding chalk\nBy beech and yew and perishing juniper\nDown the half precipices of its sides, with roots\nAnd rabbit holes for steps. The sun of Winter,\nThe moon of Summer, and all the singing birds\nExcept the missel-thrush that loves juniper,\nAre quite shut out. But far more ancient and dark\nThe Combe looks since they killed the badger there,\nDug him out and gave him to the hounds,\nThat most ancient Briton of English beasts."}
{"title":"If I Should Ever by Chance","content":"IF I should ever by chance grow rich\nI'll buy Codham, Cockridden, and Childerditch,\nRoses, Pyrgo, and Lapwater,\nAnd let them all to my elder daughter.\nThe rent I shall ask of her will be only\nEach year's first violets, white and lonely,\nThe first primroses and orchises--\nShe must find them before I do, that is.\nBut if she finds a blossom on furze\nWithout rent they shall all for ever be hers,\nCodham, Cockridden, and Childerditch,\nRoses, Pyrgo and Lapwater,--\nI shall give them all to my elder daughter."}
{"title":"What Shall I Give?","content":"WHAT shall I give my daughter the younger\nMore than will keep her from cold and hunger?\nI shall not give her anything.\nIf she shared South Weald and Havering,\nTheir acres, the two brooks running between,\nPaine's Brook and Weald Brook,\nWith pewit, woodpecker, swan, and rook,\nShe would be no richer than the queen\nWho once on a time sat in Havering Bower\nAlone, with the shadows, pleasure and power.\nShe could do no more with Samarcand,\nOr the mountains of a mountain land\nAnd its far white house above cottages\nLike Venus above the Pleiades.\nHer small hands I would not cumber\nWith so many acres and their lumber,\nBut leave her Steep and her own world\nAnd her spectacled self with hair uncurled,\nWanting a thousand little things\nThat time without contentment brings."}

{"title":"And You, Helen","content":"AND you, Helen, what should I give you?\nSo many things I would give you\nHad I an infinite great store\nOffered me and I stood before\nTo choose. I would give you youth,\nAll kinds of loveliness and truth,\nA clear eye as good as mine,\nLands, waters, flowers, wine,\nAs many children as your heart\nMight wish for, a far better art\nThan mine can be, all you have lost\nUpon the travelling waters tossed,\nOr given to me.

{"title":"When First","content":"WHEN first I came here I had hope,\nHope for I knew not what. Fast beat\nMy heart at sight of the tall slope\nOr grass and yews, as if my feet\n\nOnly by scaling its steps of chalk\nWould see something no other hill\nEver disclosed. And now I walk\nDown it the last time. Never will\n\nMy heart beat so again at sight\nOf any hill although as fair\nAnd loftier. For infinite\nThe change, late unperceived, this year,\n\nThe twelfth, suddenly, shows me plain.\nHope now,--not health, nor cheerfulness,\nSince they can come and go again,\nAs often one brief hour witnesses,--\n\nJust hope has gone for ever. Perhaps\nI may love other hills yet more\nThan this: the future and the maps\nHide something I was waiting for.\n\nOne thing I know, that love with chance\nAnd use and time and necessity\nWill grow, and louder the heart's dance\nAt parting than at meeting be."}
{"title":"Head and Bottle","content":"THE downs will lose the sun, white alyssum\nLose the bees' hum;\nBut head and bottle tilted back in the cart\nWill never part\nTill I am cold as midnight and all my hours\nAre beeless flowers.\nHe neither sees, nor hears, nor smells, nor thinks,\nBut only drinks,\nQuiet in the yard where tree trunks do not lie\nMore quietly."}
{"title":"After You Speak","content":"AFTER you speak\nAnd what you meant\nIs plain,\nMy eyes\nMeet yours that mean--\nWith your cheeks and hair--\nSomething more wise,\nMore dark,\nAnd far different.\nEven so the lark\nLoves dust\nAnd nestles in it\nThe minute\nBefore he must\nSoar in lone flight\nSo far,\nLike a black star\nHe seems--\nA mote\nOf singing dust\nAfloat\nAbove,\nThat dreams\nAnd sheds no light.\nI know your lust\nIs love."}
{"title":"Sowing","content":"IT was a perfect day\nFor sowing; just\nAs sweet and dry was the ground\nAs tobacco-dust.\n\nI tasted deep the hour\nBetween the far\nOwl's chuckling first soft cry\nAnd the first star.\n\nA long stretched hour it was;\nNothing undone\nRemained; the early seeds\nAll safely sown.\n\nAnd now, hark at the rain,\nWindless and light,\nHalf a kiss, half a tear,\nSaying good-night."}
{"title":"When We Two Walked","content":"WHEN we two walked in Lent\nWe imagined that happiness\nWas something different\nAnd this was something less.\n\nBut happy were we to hide\nOur happiness, not as they were\nWho acted in their pride\nJuno and Jupiter:\n\nFor the Gods in their jealousy\nMurdered that wife and man,\nAnd we that were wise live free\nTo recall our happiness then."}
{"title":"Women He Liked","content":"WOMEN he liked, did shovel-bearded Bob,\nOld Farmer Hayward of the Heath, but he\nLoved horses. He himself was like a cob,\nAnd leather-coloured. Also he loved a tree.\n\nFor the life in them he loved most living things,\nBut a tree chiefly. All along the lane\nHe planted elms where now the stormcock sings\nThat travellers hear from the slow-climbing train.\n\nTill then the track had never had a name\nFor all its thicket and the nightingales\nThat should have earned it. No one was to blame.\nTo name a thing beloved man sometimes fails.\n\nMany years since, Bob Hayward died, and now\nNone passes there because the mist and the rain\nOut of the elms have turned the lane to slough\nAnd gloom, the name alone survives, Bob's Lane."}
{"title":"Early One Morning","content":"EARLY one morning in May I set out,\nAnd nobody I knew was about.\n     I'm bound away for ever,\n     Away somewhere, away for ever.\n\nThere was no wind to trouble the weathercocks.\nI had burnt my letters and darned my socks.\n\nNo one knew I was going away,\nI thought myself I should come back some day.\n\nI heard the brook through the town gardens run.\nO sweet was the mud turned to dust by the sun.\n\nA gate banged in a fence and banged in my head.\n\"A fine morning, sir.\" a shepherd said.\n\nI could not return from my liberty,\nTo my youth and my love and my misery.\n\nThe past is the only dead thing that smells sweet,\nThe only sweet thing that is not also fleet.\n     I'm bound away for ever,\n     Away somewhere, away for ever."}
{"title":"It Rains","content":"IT rains, and nothing stirs within the fence\nAnywhere through the orchard's untrodden, dense\nForest of parsley. The great diamonds\nOf rain on the grassblades there is none to break,\nOr the fallen petals further down to shake.\n\nAnd I am nearly as happy as possible\nTo search the wilderness in vain though well,\nTo think of two walking, kissing there,\nDrenched, yet forgetting the kisses of the rain:\nSad, too, to think that never, never again,\n\nUnless alone, so happy shall I walk\nIn the rain. When I turn away, on its fine stalk\nTwilight has fined to naught, the parsley flower\nFigures, suspended still and ghostly white,\nThe past hovering as it revisits the light."}
{"title":"The Huxter","content":"HE has a hump like an ape on his back;\nHe has of money a plentiful lack;\nAnd but for a gay coat of double his girth\nThere is not a plainer thing on the earth\n       This fine May morning.\n\nBut the huxter has a bottle of beer;\nHe drives a cart and his wife sits near\nWho does not heed his lack or his hump;\nAnd they laugh as down the lane they bump\n       This fine May morning."}
{"title":"A Gentleman","content":"\"HE has robbed two clubs. The judge at Salisbury\nCan't give him more than he undoubtedly\nDeserves. The scoundrel! Look at his photograph!\nA lady-killer!

Just like him. A crown'd have\n   been\nMore like him. For I never knew him mean.\nOh! but he was such a nice gentleman. Oh!\nLast time we met he said if me and Joe\nWas anywhere near we must be sure and call.\nHe put his arms around our Amos all\nAs if he were his own son. I pray God\nSave him from justice! Nicer man never trod.\""}
{"title":"The Bridge","content":"I HAVE come a long way to-day:\nOn a strange bridge alone,\nRemembering friends, old friends,\nI rest, without smile or moan,\nAs they remember me without smile or moan.\n\nAll are behind, the kind\nAnd the unkind too, no more\nTo-night than a dream. The stream\nRuns softly yet drowns the Past,\nThe dark-lit stream has drowned the Future and the\n   Past.\n\nNo traveller has rest more blest\nThan this moment brief between\nTwo lives, when the Night's first lights\nAnd shades hide what has never been,\nThings goodlier, lovelier, dearer, than will be or have\n   been."}
{"title":"Lob","content":"AT hawthorn-time in Wiltshire travelling\nIn search of something chance would never bring,\nAn old man's face, by life and weather cut\nAnd coloured,--rough, brown, sweet as any nut,--\nA land face, sea-blue-eyed,--hung in my mind\nWhen I had left him many a mile behind.\nAll he said was: \"Nobody can't stop 'ee. It's\nA footpath, right enough. You see those bits\nOf mounds--that's where they opened up the barrows\nSixty years since, while I was scaring sparrows.\nThey thought as there was something to find there,\nBut couldn't find it, by digging, anywhere.\"\n\nTo turn back then and seek him, where was the use?\nThere were three Manningfords,--Abbots, Bohun, and\n   Bruce:\nAnd whether Alton, not Manningford, it was,\nMy memory could not decide, because\nThere was both Alton Barnes and Alton Priors.\nAll had their churches, graveyards, farms, and byres,\nLurking to one side up the paths and lanes,\nSeldom well seen except by aeroplanes;\nAnd when bells rang, or pigs squealed, or cocks crowed,\nThen only heard. Ages ago the road\nApproached. The people stood and looked and turned,\nNor asked it to come nearer, nor yet learned\nTo move out there and dwell in all men's dust.\nAnd yet withal they shot the weathercock, just\nBecause 'twas he crowed out of tune, they said:\nSo now the copper weathercock is dead.\nIf they had reaped their dandelions and sold\nThem fairly, they could have afforded gold.\n\nMany years passed, and I went back again\nAmong those villages, and looked for men\nWho might have known my ancient. He himself\nHad long been dead or laid upon the shelf,\nI thought. One man I asked about him roared\nAt my description: \"'Tis old Bottlesford\nHe means, Bill.\" But another said: \"Of course,\nIt was Jack Button up at the White Horse.\nHe's dead, sir, these three years.\" This lasted till\nA girl proposed Walker of Walker's Hill,\n\"Old Adam Walker. Adam's Point you'll see\nMarked on the maps.\"\n\n                      \"That was her roguery,\"\nThe next man said. He was a squire's son\nWho loved wild bird and beast, and dog and gun\nFor killing them. He had loved them from his birth,\nOne with another, as he loved the earth.\n\"The man may be like Button, or Walker, or\nLike Bottlesford, that you want, but far more\nHe sounds like one I saw when I was a child.\nI could almost swear to him. The man was wild\nAnd wandered. His home was where he was free.\nEverybody has met one such man as he.\nDoes he keep clear old paths that no one uses\nBut once a life-time when he loves or muses?\nHe is English as this gate, these flowers, this mire.\nAnd when at eight years old Lob-lie-by-the-fire\nCame in my books, this was the man I saw.\nHe has been in England as long as dove and daw,\nCalling the wild cherry tree the merry tree,\nThe rose campion Bridget-in-her-bravery;\nAnd in a tender mood he, as I guess,\nChristened one flower Love-in-idleness,\nAnd while he walked from Exeter to Leeds\nOne April called all cuckoo-flowers Milkmaids.\nFrom him old herbal Gerard learnt, as a boy,\nTo name wild clematis the Traveller's-joy.\nOur blackbirds sang no English till his ear\nTold him they called his Jan Toy 'Pretty dear.'\n(She was Jan Toy the Lucky, who, having lost\nA shilling, and found a penny loaf, rejoiced.)\nFor reasons of his own to him the wren\nIs Jenny Pooter. Before all other men\n'Twas he first called the Hog's Back the Hog's Back.\nThat Mother Dunch's Buttocks should not lack\nTheir name was his care. He too could explain\nTotteridge and Totterdown and Juggler's Lane:\nHe knows, if anyone. Why Tumbling Bay,\nInland in Kent, is called so, he might say.\n\n\"But little he says compared with what he does.\nIf ever a sage troubles him he will buzz\nLike a beehive to conclude the tedious fray:\nAnd the sage, who knows all languages, runs away.\nYet Lob has thirteen hundred names for a fool,\nAnd though he never could spare time for school\nTo unteach what the fox so well expressed,\nOn biting the cock's head off,--Quietness is best,--\nHe can talk quite as well as anyone\nAfter his thinking is forgot and done.\nHe first of all told someone else's wife,\nFor a farthing she'd skin a flint and spoil a knife\nWorth sixpence skinning it. She heard him speak:\n'She had a face as long as a wet week'\nSaid he, telling the tale in after years.\nWith blue smock and with gold rings in his ears,\nSometimes he is a pedlar, not too poor\nTo keep his wit. This is tall Tom that bore\nThe logs in, and with Shakespeare in the hall\nOnce talked, when icicles hung by the wall.\nAs Herne the Hunter he has known hard times.\nOn sleepless nights he made up weather rhymes\nWhich others spoilt. And, Hob being then his name,\nHe kept the hog that thought the butcher came\nTo bring his breakfast 'You thought wrong,' said Hob.\nWhen there were kings in Kent this very Lob,\nWhose sheep grew fat and he himself grew merry,\nWedded the king's daughter of Canterbury;\nFor he alone, unlike squire, lord, and king,\nWatched a night by her without slumbering;\nHe kept both waking. When he was but a lad\nHe won a rich man's heiress, deaf, dumb, and sad,\nBy rousing her to laugh at him. He carried\nHis donkey on his back. So they were married.\nAnd while he was a little cobbler's boy\nHe tricked the giant coming to destroy\nShrewsbury by flood. 'And how far is it yet?'\nThe giant asked in passing. 'I forget;\nBut see these shoes I've worn out on the road\nAnd we're not there yet.' He emptied out his load\nOf shoes for mending. The giant let fall from his spade\nThe earth for damming Severn, and thus made\nThe Wrekin hill; and little Ercall hill\nRose where the giant scraped his boots. While still\nSo young, our Jack was chief of Gotham's sages.\nBut long before he could have been wise, ages\nEarlier than this, while he grew thick and strong\nAnd ate his bacon, or, at times, sang a song\nAnd merely smelt it, as Jack the giant-killer\nHe made a name. He too ground up the miller,\nThe Yorkshireman who ground men's bones for flour.\n\n\"Do you believe Jack dead before his hour?\nOr that his name is Walker, or Bottlesford,\nOr Button, a mere clown, or squire, or lord?\nThe man you saw,--Lob-lie-by-the-fire, Jack Cade,\nJack Smith, Jack Moon, poor Jack of every trade,\nYoung Jack, or old Jack, or Jack What-d'ye-call,\nJack-in-the-hedge, or Robin-run-by-the-wall,\nRobin Hood, Ragged Robin, lazy Bob,\nOne of the lords of No Man's Land, good Lob,--\nAlthough he was seen dying at Waterloo,\nHastings, Agincourt, and Sedgemoor too,--\nLives yet. He never will admit he is dead\nTill millers cease to grind men's bones for bread,\nNot till our weathercock crows once again\nAnd I remove my house out of the lane\nOn to the road.\" With this he disappeared\nIn hazel and thorn tangled with old-man's-beard.\nBut one glimpse of his back, as there he stood,\nChoosing his way, proved him of old Jack's blood\nYoung Jack perhaps, and now a Wiltshireman\nAs he has oft been since his days began."}
{"title":"Bright Clouds","content":"BRIGHT clouds of may\nShade half the pond.\nBeyond,\nAll but one bay\nOf emerald\nTall reeds\nLike criss-cross bayonets\nWhere a bird once called,\nLies bright as the sun.\nNo one heeds.\nThe light wind frets\nAnd drifts the scum\nOf may-blossom.\nTill the moorhen calls\nAgain\nNaught's to be done\nBy birds or men.\nStill the may falls."}

{"title":"May 23","content":"THERE never was a finer day,\nAnd never will be while May is May,--\nThe third, and not the last of its kind;\nBut though fair and clear the two behind\nSeemed pursued by tempests overpast;\nAnd the morrow with fear that it could not last\nWas spoiled. To-day ere the stones were warm\nFive minutes of thunderstorm\nDashed it with rain, as if to secure,\nBy one tear, its beauty the luck to endure.\n\nAt mid-day then along the lane\nOld Jack Noman appeared again,\nJaunty and old, crooked and tall,\nAnd stopped and grinned at me over the wall,\nWith a cowslip bunch in his button-hole\nAnd one in his cap. Who could say if his roll\nCame from flints in the road, the weather, or ale?\nHe was welcome as the nightingale.\nNot an hour of the sun had been wasted on Jack\n\"I've got my Indian complexion back\"\nSaid he. He was tanned like a harvester,\nLike his short clay pipe, like the leaf and bur\nThat clung to his coat from last night's bed,\nLike the ploughland crumbling red.\nFairer flowers were none on the earth\nThan his cowslips wet with the dew of their birth,\nOr fresher leaves than the cress in his basket.\n\"Where did they come from, Jack?\" \"Don't ask it,\nAnd you'll be told no lies.\" \"Very well:\nThen I can't buy.\" \"I don't want to sell.\nTake them and these flowers, too, free.\nPerhaps you have something to give me?\nWait till next time. The better the day . . .\nThe Lord couldn't make a better, I say;\nIf he could, he never has done.\"\nSo off went Jack with his roll-walk-run,\nLeaving his cresses from Oakshott rill\nAnd his cowslips from Wheatham hill.\n\n'Twas the first day that the midges bit;\nBut though they bit me, I was glad of it:\nOf the dust in my face, too, I was glad.\nSpring could do nothing to make me sad.\nBluebells hid all the ruts in the copse.\nThe elm seeds lay in the road like hops,\nThat fine day, May the twenty-third,\nThe day Jack Noman disappeared."}
{"title":"The Glory","content":"THE glory of the beauty of the morning,--\nThe cuckoo crying over the untouched dew;\nThe blackbird that has found it, and the dove\nThat tempts me on to something sweeter than love;\nWhite clouds ranged even and fair as new-mown hay;\nThe heat, the stir, the sublime vacancy\nOf sky and meadow and forest and my own heart:--\nThe glory invites me, yet it leaves me scorning\nAll I can ever do, all I can be,\nBeside the lovely of motion, shape, and hue,\nThe happiness I fancy fit to dwell\nIn beauty's presence. Shall I now this day\nBegin to seek as far as heaven, as hell,\nWisdom or strength to match this beauty, start\nAnd tread the pale dust pitted with small dark drops,\nIn hope to find whatever it is I seek,\nHearkening to short-lived happy-seeming things\nThat we know naught of, in the hazel copse?\nOr must I be content with discontent\nAs larks and swallows are perhaps with wings?\nAnd shall I ask at the day's end once more\nWhat beauty is, and what I can have meant\nBy happiness? And shall I let all go,\nGlad, weary, or both? Or shall I perhaps know\nThat I was happy oft and oft before,\nAwhile forgetting how I am fast pent,\nHow dreary-swift, with naught to travel to,\nIs Time? I cannot bite the day to the core."}
{"title":"Adlestrop","content":"YES. I remember Adlestrop--\nThe name, because one afternoon\nOf heat the express-train drew up there\nUnwontedly. It was late June.\n\nThe steam hissed.

What I saw\nWas Adlestrop--only the name\n\nAnd willows, willow-herb, and grass,\nAnd meadowsweet, and haycocks dry,\nNo whit less still and lonely fair\nThan the high cloudlets in the sky.\n\nAnd for that minute a blackbird sang\nClose by, and round him, mistier,\nFarther and farther, all the birds\nOf Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire."}

{"title":"The Mill-Pond","content":"THE sun blazed while the thunder yet\nAdded a boom:\nA wagtail flickered bright over\nThe mill-pond's gloom:\n\nLess than the cooing in the alder\nIsles of the pool\nSounded the thunder through that plunge\nOf waters cool.\n\nScared starlings on the aspen tip\nPast the black mill\nOutchattered the stream and the next roar\nFar on the hill.\n\nAs my feet dangling teased the foam\nThat slid below\nA girl came out. \"Take care!\" she said--\nAges ago.\n\nShe startled me, standing quite close\nDressed all in white:\nAges ago I was angry till\nShe passed from sight.\n\nThen the storm burst, and as I crouched\nTo shelter, how\nBeautiful and kind, too, she seemed,\nAs she does now!"}
{"title":"Haymaking","content":"AFTER night's thunder far away had rolled\nThe fiery day had a kernel sweet of cold,\nAnd in the perfect blue the clouds uncurled,\nLike the first gods before they made the world\nAnd misery, swimming the stormless sea\nIn beauty and in divine gaiety.\nThe smooth white empty road was lightly strewn\nWith leaves--the holly's Autumn falls in June--\nAnd fir cones standing stiff up in the heat.\nThe mill-foot water tumbled white and lit\nWith tossing crystals, happier than any crowd\nOf children pouring out of school aloud.\nAnd in the little thickets where a sleeper\nFor ever might lie lost, the nettle-creeper\nAnd garden warbler sang unceasingly;\nWhile over them shrill shrieked in his fierce glee\nThe swift with wings and tail as sharp and narrow\nAs if the bow had flown off with the arrow.\nOnly the scent of woodbine and hay new-mown\nTravelled the road. In the field sloping down,\nPark-like, to where its willows showed the brook,\nHaymakers rested. The tosser lay forsook\nOut in the sun; and the long waggon stood\nWithout its team, it seemed it never would\nMove from the shadow of that single yew.\nThe team, as still, until their task was due,\nBeside the labourers enjoyed the shade\nThat three squat oaks mid-field together made\nUpon a circle of grass and weed uncut,\nAnd on the hollow, once a chalk-pit, but\nNow brimmed with nut and elder-flower so clean.\nThe men leaned on their rakes, about to begin,\nBut still. And all were silent. All was old,\nThis morning time, with a great age untold,\nOlder than Clare and Cobbett, Morland and Crome,\nThan, at the field's far edge, the farmer's home,\nA white house crouched at the foot of a great tree.\nUnder the heavens that know not what years be\nThe men, the beasts, the trees, the implements\nUttered even what they will in times far hence--\nAll of us gone out of the reach of change--\nImmortal in a picture of an old grange."}

{"title":"The Sun Used to Shine","content":"THE sun used to shine while we two walked\nSlowly together, paused and started\nAgain, and sometimes mused, sometimes talked\nAs either pleased, and cheerfully parted\n\nEach night. We never disagreed\nWhich gate to rest on.

The war\nCame back to mind with the moonrise\nWhich soldiers in the east afar\nBeheld then. Nevertheless, our eyes\n\nCould as well imagine the Crusades\nOr Caesar's battles. Everything\nTo faintness like those rumours fades--\nLike the brook's water glittering\n\nUnder the moonlight--like those walks\nNow--like us two that took them, and\nThe fallen apples, all the talks\nAnd silences--like memory's sand\n\nWhen the tide covers it late or soon,\nAnd other men through other flowers\nIn those fields under the same moon\nGo talking and have easy hours."}

{"title":"The Long Small Room","content":"THE long small room that showed willows in the west\nNarrowed up to the end the fireplace filled,\nAlthough not wide. I liked it. No one guessed\nWhat need or accident made them so build.\n\nOnly the moon, the mouse and the sparrow peeped\nIn from the ivy round the casement thick.\nOf all they saw and heard there they shall keep\nThe tale for the old ivy and older brick.\n\nWhen I look back I am like moon, sparrow and mouse\nThat witnessed what they could never understand\nOr alter or prevent in the dark house.\nOne thing remains the same--this my right hand\n\nCrawling crab-like over the clean white page,\nResting awhile each morning on the pillow,\nThen once more starting to crawl on towards age.\nThe hundred last leaves stream upon the willow."}
{"title":"Liberty","content":"THE last light has gone out of the world, except\nThis moonlight lying on the grass like frost\nBeyond the brink of the tall elm's shadow\nIt is as if everything else had slept\nMany an age, unforgotten and lost\nThe men that were, the things done, long ago,\nAll I have thought; and but the moon and I\nLive yet and here stand idle over the grave\nWhere all is buried. Both have liberty\nTo dream what we could do if we were free\nTo do some thing we had desired long,\nThe moon and I. There's none less free than who\nDoes nothing and has nothing else to do,\nBeing free only for what is not to his mind,\nAnd nothing is to his mind.

{"title":"The New House","content":"Now first, as I shut the door,\n  I was alone\nIn the new house; and the wind\n  Began to moan.\n\nOld at once was the house,\n  And I was old;\nMy ears were teased with the dread\n  Of what was foretold,\n\nNights of storm, days of mist, without end;\n  Sad days when the sun\nShone in vain: old griefs and griefs\n  Not yet begun.\n\nAll was foretold me; naught\n  Could I foresee;\nBut I learned how the wind would sound\n  After these things should be."}
{"title":"March","content":"Now I know that Spring will come again,\nPerhaps to-morrow: however late I've patience\nAfter this night following on such a day.\n\nWhile still my temples ached from the cold burning\nOf hail and wind, and still the primroses\nTorn by the hail were covered up in it,\nThe sun filled earth and heaven with a great light\nAnd a tenderness, almost warmth, where the hail\n   dripped,\nAs if the mighty sun wept tears of joy.\nBut 'twas too late for warmth. The sunset piled\nMountains on mountains of snow and ice in the\n   west:\nSomewhere among their folds the wind was lost,\nAnd yet 'twas cold, and though I knew that\n   Spring\nWould come again, I knew it had not come,\nThat it was lost too in those mountains chill.\n\nWhat did the thrushes know? Rain, snow, sleet,\n   hail,\nHad kept them quiet as the primroses.\nThey had but an hour to sing. On boughs they\n   sang,\nOn gates, on ground; they sang while they\n   changed perches\nAnd while they fought, if they remembered to\n   fight:\nSo earnest were they to pack into that hour\nTheir unwilling hoard of song before the moon\nGrew brighter than the clouds. Then 'twas\n   no time\nFor singing merely. So they could keep off silence\nAnd night, they cared not what they sang or\n   screamed;\nWhether 'twas hoarse or sweet or fierce or soft;\nAnd to me all was sweet: they could do no wrong.\nSomething they knew--I also, while they sang\nAnd after. Not till night had half its stars\nAnd never a cloud, was I aware of silence\nStained with all that hour's songs, a silence\nSaying that Spring returns, perhaps to-morrow."}
{"title":"The Cuckoo","content":"THAT'S the cuckoo, you say.

Ho!\"\n\nTen times with an angry voice he shouted\n\"Ho! Ho!\" but not in anger, for that was his\n    way.\nHe died that Summer, and that is how I remember\nThe cuckoo calling, the children listening, and me\n    saying, \"Nay.\"\n\nAnd now, as you said, \"There it is,\" I was hearing\nNot the cuckoo at all, but my man's \"Ho!

{"title":"Over the Hills","content":"OFTEN and often it came back again\nTo mind, the day I passed the horizon ridge\nTo a new country, the path I had to find\nBy half-gaps that were stiles once in the hedge,\nThe pack of scarlet clouds running across\nThe harvest evening that seemed endless then\nAnd after, and the inn where all were kind,\nAll were strangers. I did not know my loss\nTill one day twelve months later suddenly\nI leaned upon my spade and saw it all,\nThough far beyond the sky-line. It became\nAlmost a habit through the year for me\nTo lean and see it and think to do the same\nAgain for two days and a night.

Less than a mile\nBeyond the inn, I could recall\nHe was like me in general.\n\nHe had pleased them, but I less.\nI was more eager than before\nTo find him out and to confess,\nTo bore him and to let him bore.\nI could not wait: children might guess\nI had a purpose, something more\nThat made an answer indiscreet.\nOne girl's caution made me sore,\nToo indignant even to greet\nThat other had we chanced to meet.\n\nI sought then in solitude.\nThe wind had fallen with the night; as still\nThe roads lay as the ploughland rude,\nDark and naked, on the hill.\nHad there been ever any feud\n'Twixt earth and sky, a mighty will\nClosed it: the crocketed dark trees,\nA dark house, dark impossible\nCloud-towers, one star, one lamp, one peace\nHeld on an everlasting lease:\n\nAnd all was earth's, or all was sky's;\nNo difference endured between\nThe two. A dog barked on a hidden rise;\nA marshbird whistled high unseen;\nThe latest waking blackbird's cries\nPerished upon the silence keen.\nThe last light filled a narrow firth\nAmong the clouds. I stood serene,\nAnd with a solemn quiet mirth,\nAn old inhabitant of earth.\n\nOnce the name I gave to hours\nLike this was melancholy, when\nIt was not happiness and powers\nComing like exiles home again,\nAnd weaknesses quitting their bowers,\nSmiled and enjoyed, far off from men,\nMoments of everlastingness.\nAnd fortunate my search was then\nWhile what I sought, nevertheless,\nThat I was seeking, I did not guess.\n\nThat time was brief: once more at inn\nAnd upon road I sought my man\nTill once amid a tap-room's din\nLoudly he asked for me, began\nTo speak, as if it had been a sin,\nOf how I thought and dreamed and ran\nAfter him thus, day after day:\nHe lived as one under a ban\nFor this: what had I got to say?\nI said nothing, I slipped away.\n\nAnd now I dare not follow after\nToo close. I try to keep in sight,\nDreading his frown and worse his laughter.\nI steal out of the wood to light;\nI see the swift shoot from the rafter\nBy the inn door: ere I alight\nI wait and hear the starlings wheeze\nAnd nibble like ducks: I wait his flight.\nHe goes: I follow: no release\nUntil he ceases. Then I also shall cease."}

The shoddy jostle with the chic:\nTurk and Roumanian and Greek; student and officer and sport;\n\n\nSlavs with their peasant, Christ-like heads,\nand courtezans like powdered moths,\nAnd peddlers from Algiers, with cloths\nbright-hued and stitched with golden threads;\n\n\nAnd painters with big, serious eyes go rapt in dreams, fantastic shapes\nIn corduroys and Spanish capes and locks uncut and flowing ties;\n\n\nAnd lovers wander two by two, oblivious among the press,\nAnd making one of them no less, all lovers shall be dear to you:\n\n\nAll laughing lips you move among, all happy hearts that, knowing what\nMakes life worth while, have wasted not the sweet reprieve of being young.\n\n\n\"Comment ca va!\" \"Mon vieux!\" \"Mon cher!\"\nFriends greet and banter as they pass.\n'Tis sweet to see among the mass comrades and lovers everywhere,\n\n\nA law that's sane, a Love that's free, and men of every birth and blood\nAllied in one great brotherhood of Art and Joy and Poverty. . . .\n\n\nThe open cafe-windows frame loungers at their liqueurs and beer,\nAnd walking past them one can hear fragments of Tosca and Boheme.\n\n\nAnd in the brilliant-lighted door of cinemas the barker calls,\nAnd lurid posters paint the walls with scenes of Love and crime and war.\n\n\nBut follow past the flaming lights, borne onward with the stream of feet,\nWhere Bullier's further up the street is marvellous on Thursday nights.\n\n\nHere all Bohemia flocks apace; you could not often find elsewhere\nSo many happy heads and fair assembled in one time and place.\n\n\nUnder the glare and noise and heat the galaxy of dancing whirls,\nSmokers, with covered heads, and girls dressed in the costume of the street.\n\n\nFrom tables packed around the wall the crowds that drink and frolic there\nSpin serpentines into the air far out over the reeking hall,\n\n\nThat, settling where the coils unroll, tangle with pink and green and blue\nThe crowds that rag to \"Hitchy-koo\" and boston to the \"Barcarole\". . . .\n\n\nHere Mimi ventures, at fifteen, to make her debut in romance,\nAnd join her sisters in the dance and see the life that they have seen.\n\n\nHer hair, a tight hat just allows to brush beneath the narrow brim,\nDocked, in the model's present whim, `frise' and banged above the brows.\n\n\nUncorseted, her clinging dress with every step and turn betrays,\nIn pretty and provoking ways her adolescent loveliness,\n\n\nAs guiding Gaby or Lucile she dances, emulating them\nIn each disturbing stratagem and each lascivious appeal.\n\n\nEach turn a challenge, every pose an invitation to compete,\nAlong the maze of whirling feet the grave-eyed little wanton goes,\n\n\nAnd, flaunting all the hue that lies in childish cheeks and nubile waist,\nShe passes, charmingly unchaste, illumining ignoble eyes. . . .\n\n\nBut now the blood from every heart leaps madder through abounding veins\nAs first the fascinating strains of \"El Irresistible\" start.\n\n\nCaught in the spell of pulsing sound, impatient elbows lift and yield\nThe scented softnesses they shield to arms that catch and close them round,\n\n\nSurrender, swift to be possessed, the silken supple forms beneath\nTo all the bliss the measures breathe and all the madness they suggest.\n\n\nCrowds congregate and make a ring. Four deep they stand and strain to see\nThe tango in its ecstasy of glowing lives that clasp and cling.\n\n\nLithe limbs relaxed, exalted eyes fastened on vacancy, they seem\nTo float upon the perfumed stream of some voluptuous Paradise,\n\n\nOr, rapt in some Arabian Night, to rock there, cradled and subdued,\nIn a luxurious lassitude of rhythm and sensual delight.\n\n\nAnd only when the measures cease and terminate the flowing dance\nThey waken from their magic trance and join the cries that clamor \"Bis!\" . . .\n\n\nMidnight adjourns the festival. The couples climb the crowded stair,\nAnd out into the warm night air go singing fragments of the ball.\n\n\nClose-folded in desire they pass, or stop to drink and talk awhile\nIn the cafes along the mile from Bullier's back to Montparnasse:\n\n\nThe \"Closerie\" or \"La Rotonde\", where smoking, under lamplit trees,\nSit Art's enamored devotees, chatting across their `brune' and `blonde'. . . .\n\n\nMake one of them and come to know sweet Paris -- not as many do,\nSeeing but the folly of the few, the froth, the tinsel, and the show --\n\n\nBut taking some white proffered hand that from Earth's barren every day\nCan lead you by the shortest way into Love's florid fairyland.\n\n\nAnd that divine enchanted life that lurks under Life's common guise --\nThat city of romance that lies within the City's toil and strife --\n\n\nShall, knocking, open to your hands, for Love is all its golden key,\nAnd one's name murmured tenderly the only magic it demands.\n\n\nAnd when all else is gray and void in the vast gulf of memory,\nGreen islands of delight shall be all blessed moments so enjoyed:\n\n\nWhen vaulted with the city skies, on its cathedral floors you stood,\nAnd, priest of a bright brotherhood, performed the mystic sacrifice,\n\n\nAt Love's high altar fit to stand, with fire and incense aureoled,\nThe celebrant in cloth of gold with Spring and Youth on either hand.\n\nIII\n\n\nChoral Song\n\n\nHave ye gazed on its grandeur\nOr stood where it stands\nWith opal and amber\nAdorning the lands,\nAnd orcharded domes\nOf the hue of all flowers?\nSweet melody roams\nThrough its blossoming bowers,\nSweet bells usher in from its belfries the train of the honey-sweet hour.\n\n\nA city resplendent,\nFulfilled of good things,\nOn its ramparts are pendent\nThe bucklers of kings.\nBroad banners unfurled\nAre afloat in its air.\nThe lords of the world\nLook for harborage there.\nNone finds save he comes as a bridegroom, having roses and vine in his hair.\n\n\n'Tis the city of Lovers,\nThere many paths meet.\nBlessed he above others,\nWith faltering feet,\nWho past its proud spires\nIntends not nor hears\nThe noise of its lyres\nGrow faint in his ears!\nMen reach it through portals of triumph, but leave through a postern of tears.\n\n\nIt was thither, ambitious,\nWe came for Youth's right,\nWhen our lips yearned for kisses\nAs moths for the light,\nWhen our souls cried for Love\nAs for life-giving rain\nWan leaves of the grove,\nWithered grass of the plain,\nAnd our flesh ached for Love-flesh beside it with bitter, intolerable pain.\n\n\nUnder arbor and trellis,\nFull of flutes, full of flowers,\nWhat mad fortunes befell us,\nWhat glad orgies were ours!\nIn the days of our youth,\nIn our festal attire,\nWhen the sweet flesh was smooth,\nWhen the swift blood was fire,\nAnd all Earth paid in orange and purple to pavilion the bed of Desire!"}

{"title":"The Deserted Garden","content":"I know a village in a far-off land\nWhere from a sunny, mountain-girdled plain\nWith tinted walls a space on either hand\nAnd fed by many an olive-darkened lane\nThe high-road mounts, and thence a silver band\nThrough vineyard slopes above and rolling grain,\nWinds off to that dim corner of the skies\nWhere behind sunset hills a stately city lies.\n\nHere, among trees whose overhanging shade\nStrews petals on the little droves below,\nPattering townward in the morning weighed\nWith greens from many an upland garden-row,\nRuns an old wall; long centuries have frayed\nIts scalloped edge, and passers to and fro\nHeard never from beyond its crumbling height\nSweet laughter ring at noon or plaintive song at night.\n\nBut here where little lizards bask and blink\nThe tendrils of the trumpet-vine have run,\nAt whose red bells the humming bird to drink\nStops oft before his garden feast is done;\nAnd rose-geraniums, with that tender pink\nThat cloud-banks borrow from the setting sun,\nHave covered part of this old wall, entwined\nWith fair plumbago, blue as evening heavens behind.\n\nAnd crowning other parts the wild white rose\nRivals the honey-suckle with the bees.\nAbove the old abandoned orchard shows\nAnd all within beneath the dense-set trees,\nTall and luxuriant the rank grass grows,\nThat settled in its wavy depth one sees\nGrass melt in leaves, the mossy trunks between,\nDown fading avenues of implicated green;\n\nWherein no lack of flowers the verdurous night\nWith stars and pearly nebula o'erlay;\nAzalea-boughs half rosy and half white\nShine through the green and clustering apple-spray,\nSuch as the fairy-queen before her knight\nWaved in old story, luring him away\nWhere round lost isles Hesperian billows break\nOr towers loom up beneath the clear, translucent lake;\n\nAnd under the deep grass blue hare-bells hide,\nAnd myrtle plots with dew-fall ever wet,\nGay tiger-lilies flammulate and pied,\nSometime on pathway borders neatly set,\nNow blossom through the brake on either side,\nWhere heliotrope and weedy mignonette,\nWith vines in bloom and flower-bearing trees,\nMingle their incense all to swell the perfumed breeze,\n\nThat sprung like Hermes from his natal cave\nIn some blue rampart of the curving West,\nComes up the valleys where green cornfields wave,\nRavels the cloud about the mountain crest,\nBreathes on the lake till gentle ripples pave\nIts placid floor; at length a long-loved guest,\nHe steals across this plot of pleasant ground,\nWaking the vocal leaves to a sweet vernal sound.\n\nHere many a day right gladly have I sped,\nContent amid the wavy plumes to lie,\nAnd through the woven branches overhead\nWatch the white, ever-wandering clouds go by,\nAnd soaring birds make their dissolving bed\nFar in the azure depths of summer sky,\nOr nearer that small huntsman of the air,\nThe fly-catcher, dart nimbly from his leafy lair;\n\nPillowed at case to hear the merry tune\nOf mating warblers in the boughs above\nAnd shrill cicadas whom the hottest noon\nKeeps not from drowsy song; the mourning dove\nPours down the murmuring grove his plaintive croon\nThat like the voice of visionary love\nOft have I risen to seek through this green maze\n(Even as my feet thread now the great world's garden-ways);\n\nAnd, parting tangled bushes as I passed\nDown beechen allies beautiful and dim,\nPerhaps by some deep-shaded pool at last\nMy feet would pause, where goldfish poise and swim,\nAnd snowy callas' velvet cups are massed\nAround the mossy, fern-encircled brim.\nHere, then, that magic summoning would cease,\nOr sound far off again among the orchard trees.\n\nAnd here where the blanched lilies of the vale\nAnd violets and yellow star-flowers teem,\nAnd pink and purple hyacinths exhale\nTheir heavy fume, once more to drowse and dream\nMy head would sink, from many an olden tale\nDrawing imagination's fervid theme,\nOr haply peopling this enchanting spot\nOnly with fair creations of fantastic thought.\n\nFor oft I think, in years long since gone by,\nThat gentle hearts dwelt here and gentle hands\nStored all this bowery bliss to beautify\nThe paradise of some unsung romance;\nHere, safe from all except the loved one's eye,\n'Tis sweet to think white limbs were wont to glance,\nWell pleased to wanton like the flowers and share\nTheir simple loveliness with the enamored air.\n\nThrice dear to them whose votive fingers decked\nThe altars of First Love were these green ways,\nThese lawns and verdurous brakes forever flecked\nWith the warm sunshine of midsummer days;\nOft where the long straight allies intersect\nAnd marble seats surround the open space,\nWhere a tiled pool and sculptured fountain stand,\nHath Evening found them seated, silent, hand in hand.\n\nWhen twilight deepened, in the gathering shade\nBeneath that old titanic cypress row,\nWhose sombre vault and towering colonnade\nDwarfed the enfolded forms that moved below,\nOft with close steps these happy lovers strayed,\nTill down its darkening aisle the sunset glow\nGrew less and patterning the garden floor\nFaint flakes of filtering moonlight mantled more and more.\n\nAnd the strange tempest that a touch imparts\nThrough the mid fibre of the molten frame,\nWhen the sweet flesh in early youth asserts\nIts heyday verve and little hints enflame,\nDisturbed them as they walked; from their full hearts\nWelled the soft word, and many a tender name\nStrove on their lips as breast to breast they strained\nAnd the deep joy they drank seemed never, never drained.\n\nLove's soul that is the depth of starry skies\nSet in the splendor of one upturned face\nTo beam adorably through half-closed eyes;\nLove's body where the breadth of summer days\nAnd all the beauty earth and air comprise\nCome to the compass of an arm's embrace,\nTo burn a moment on impassioned lips\nAnd yield intemperate joy to quivering finger-tips,\n\nThey knew; and here where morning-glories cling\nRound carven forms of carefullest artifice,\nThey made a bower where every outward thing\nShould comment on the cause of their own bliss;\nWith flowers of liveliest hue encompassing\nThat flower that the beloved body is\nThat rose that for the banquet of Love's bee\nHas budded all the æons of past eternity.\n\nBut their choice seat was where the garden wall,\nCrowning a little summit, far and near,\nLooks over tufted treetops onto all\nThe pleasant outer country; rising here\nFrom rustling foliage where cuckoos call\nOn summer evenings, stands a belvedere,\nBuff-hued, of antique plaster, overrun\nWith flowering vines and weatherworn by rain and sun.\n\nStill round the turrets of this antique tower\nThe bougainvillea hangs a crimson crown,\nWistaria-vines and clematis in flower,\nWreathing the lower surface further down,\nHide the old plaster in a very shower\nOf motley blossoms like a broidered gown.\nOutside, ascending from the garden grove,\nA crumbling stairway winds to the one room above.\n\nAnd whoso mounts by this dismantled stair\nFinds the old pleasure-hall, long disarrayed,\nBrick-tiled and raftered, and the walls foursquare\nRinged all about with a twofold arcade.\nBackward dense branches intercept the glare\nOf afternoon with eucalyptus shade;\nEastward the level valley-plains expand,\nSweet as a queen's survey of her own Fairyland.\n\nFor through that frame the ivied arches make,\nWide tracts of sunny midland charm the eye,\nFrequent with hamlet grove, and lucent lake\nWhere the blue hills' inverted contours lie;\nFar to the east where billowy mountains break\nIn surf of snow against a sapphire sky,\nHuge thunderheads loom up behind the ranges,\nChanging from gold to pink as deepening sunset changes;\n\nAnd over plain and far sierra spread\nThe fulgent rays of fading afternoon,\nShowing each utmost peak and watershed\nAll clarified, each tassel and festoon\nOf floating cloud embroidered overhead,\nLike lotus-leaves on bluest waters strewn,\nFlushing with rose, while all breathes fresh and free\nIn peace and amplitude and bland tranquillity.\n\nDear were such evenings to this gentle pair;\nLove's tide that launched on with a blast too strong\nSweeps toward the foaming reef, the hidden snare,\nBaffling with fond illusion's siren-song,\nToo faint, on idle shoals, to linger there\nFar from Youth's glowing dream, bore them along,\nWith purple sail and steered by seraph hands\nTo isles resplendent in the sunset of romance.\n\nAnd out of this old house a flowery fane,\nA bridal bower, a pearly pleasure-dome,\nThey built, and furnished it with gold and grain,\nAnd bade all spirits of beauty hither come,\nAnd wingéd Love to enter with his train\nAnd bless their pillow, and in this his home\nMake them his priests as Hero was of yore\nIn her sweet girlhood by the blue Dardanian shore.\n\nTree-ferns, therefore, and potted palms they brought,\nTripods and urns in rare and curious taste,\nPolychrome chests and cabinets inwrought\nWith pearl and ivory etched and interlaced;\nPendant brocades with massive braid were caught,\nAnd chain-slung, oriental lamps so placed\nTo light the lounger on some low divan,\nSunken in swelling down and silks from Hindustan.\n\nAnd there was spread, upon the ample floors,\nWork of the Levantine's laborious loom,\nSuch as by Euxine or Ionian shores\nCarpets the dim seraglio's scented gloom.\nEach morn renewed, the garden's flowery stores\nBlushed in fair vases, ochre and peach-bloom,\nAnd little birds through wicker doors left wide\nFlew in to trill a space from the green world outside.\n\nAnd there was many a dainty attitude,\nBronze and eburnean. All but disarrayed,\nHere in eternal doubt sweet Psyche stood\nFain of the bath's delight, yet still afraid\nLest aught in that palatial solitude\nLurked of most menace to a helpless maid.\nTherefore forever faltering she stands,\nNor yet the last loose fold slips rippling from her hands.\n\nClose by upon a beryl column, clad\nIn the fresh flower of adolescent grace,\nThey set the dear Bithynian shepherd lad,\nThe nude Antinous. That gentle face,\nForever beautiful, forever sad,\nShows but one aspect, moon-like, to our gaze,\nYet Fancy pictures how those lips could smile\nAt revelries in Rome, and banquets on the Nile.\n\nAnd there were shapes of Beauty myriads more,\nClustering their rosy bridal bed around,\nWhose scented breadth a silken fabric wore\nBroidered with peacock hues on creamiest ground,\nFit to have graced the barge that Cydnus bore\nOr Venus' bed in her enchanted mound,\nWhile pillows swelled in stuffs of Orient dyes,\nAll broidered with strange fruits and birds of Paradise.\n\n'Twas such a bower as Youth has visions of,\nThither with one fair spirit to retire,\nLie upon rose-leaves, sleep and wake with Love\nAnd feast on kisses to the heart's desire;\nWhere by a casement opening on a grove,\nWide to the wood-winds and the sweet birds' choir,\nA girl might stand and gaze into green boughs,\nLike Credhe at the window of her golden house.\n\nOr most like Vivien, the enchanting fay,\nWhere with her friend, in the strange tower they planned,\nShe lies and dreams eternity away,\nAbove the treetops in Broceliande,\nSometimes at twilight when the woods are gray\nAnd wolf-packs howl far out across the lande,\nWaking to love, while up behind the trees\nThe large midsummer moon lifts-even so loved these.\n\nFor here, their pleasure was to come and sit\nOft when the sun sloped midway to the west,\nWatching with sweet enjoyment interknit\nThe long light slant across the green earth's breast,\nAnd clouds upon the ranges opposite,\nRolled up into a gleaming thundercrest,\nTopple and break and fall in purple rain,\nAnd mist of summer showers trail out across the plain.\n\nWhereon the shafts of ardent light, far-flung\nAcross the luminous azure overhead,\nOfttimes in arcs of transient beauty hung\nThe fragmentary rainbow's green and red.\nJoy it was here to love and to be young,\nTo watch the sun sink to his western bed,\nAnd streaming back out of their flaming core\nThe vesperal aurora's glorious banners soar.\n\nTinging each altitude of heaven in turn,\nThose fiery rays would sweep. The cumuli\nThat peeped above the mountain-tops would burn\nCarmine a space; the cirrus-whorls on high,\nMore delicate than sprays of maiden fern,\nStreak with pale rose the peacock-breasted sky,\nThen blanch. As water-lilies fold at night,\nSank back into themselves those plumes of fervid light.\n\nAnd they would watch the first faint stars appear,\nThe blue East blend with the blue hills below,\nAs lovers when their shuddering bliss draws near\nInto one pulse of fluid rapture grow.\nNew fragrance on the freshening atmosphere\nWould steal with evening, and the sunset glow\nDraw deeper down into the wondrous west\nRound vales of Proserpine and islands of the blest.\n\nSo dusk would come and mingle lake and shore,\nThe snow-peaks fade to frosty, opaline,\nTo pearl the doméd clouds the mountains bore,\nWhere late the sun's effulgent fire had been\nShowing as darkness deepened more and more\nThe incandescent lightnings flare within,\nAnd Night that furls the lily in the glen\nAnd twines impatient arms would fall, and then---and then . . .\n\nSometimes the peasant, coming late from town\nWith empty panniers on his little drove\nPast the old lookout when the Northern Crown\nGlittered with Cygnus through the scented grove,\nWould hear soft noise of lute-strings wafted down\nAnd voices singing through the leaves above\nThose songs that well from the warm heart that woos\nAt balconies in Merida or Vera Cruz.\n\nAnd he would pause under the garden wall,\nCaught in the spell of that voluptuous strain,\nWith all the sultry South in it, and all\nIts importunity of love and pain;\nAnd he would wait till the last passionate fall\nDied on the night, and all was still again.\nThen to his upland village wander home,\nMarvelling whence that flood of elfin song might come.\n\nO lyre that Love's white holy hands caress,\nYouth, from thy bosom welled their passionate lays\nSweet opportunity for happiness\nSo brief, so passing beautiful---O days,\nWhen to the heart's divine indulgences\nAll earth in smiling ministration pays\nThine was the source whose plenitude, past over,\nWhat prize shall rest to pluck, what secret to discover!\n\nThe wake of color that follows her when May\nWalks on the hills loose-haired and daisy-crowned,\nThe deep horizons of a summer's day,\nFair cities, and the pleasures that abound\nWhere music calls, and crowds in bright array\nGather by night to find and to be found;\nWhat were these worth or all delightful things\nWithout thine eyes to read their true interpretings!\n\nFor thee the mountains open glorious gates,\nTo thee white arms put out from orient skies,\nEarth, like a jewelled bride for one she waits,\nDecks but to be delicious in thine eyes,\nThou guest of honor for one day, whose fêtes\nEternity has travailed to devise;\nAh, grace them well in the brief hour they last!\nAnother's turn prepares, another follows fast.\n\nYet not without one fond memorial\nLet my sun set who found the world so fair!\nFrail verse, when Time the singer's coronal\nHas rent, and stripped the rose-leaves from his hair,\nBe thou my tablet on the temple wall!\nAmong the pious testimonials there,\nWitness how sweetly on my heart as well\nThe miracles of dawn and starry evening fell!\n\nSpeak of one then who had the lust to feel,\nAnd, from the hues that far horizons take,\nAnd cloud and sunset, drank the wild appeal,\nToo deep to live for aught but life's sweet sake,\nWhose only motive was the will to kneel\nWhere Beauty's purest benediction spake,\nWho only coveted what grove and field\nAnd sunshine and green Earth and tender arms could yield---\n\nA nympholept, through pleasant days and drear\nSeeking his faultless adolescent dream,\nA pilgrim down the paths that disappear\nIn mist and rainbows on the world's extreme,\nA helpless voyager who all too near\nThe mouth of Life's fair flower-bordered stream,\nClutched at Love's single respite in his need\nMore than the drowning swimmer clutches at a reed---\n\nThat coming one whose feet in other days\nShall bleed like mine for ever having, more\nThan any purpose, felt the need to praise\nAnd seek the angelic image to adore,\nIn love with Love, its wonderful, sweet ways\nCounting what most makes life worth living for,\nThat so some relic may be his to see\nHow I loved these things too and they were dear to me.\n\nI sometimes think a conscious happiness\nMantles through all the rose's sentient vine\nWhen summer winds with myriad calyces\nOf bloom its clambering height incarnadine;\nI sometimes think that cleaving lips, no less,\nAnd limbs that crowned desires at length entwine\nAre nerves through which that being drinks delight,\nWhose frame is the green Earth robed round with day and night.\n\nAnd such were theirs: the traveller without,\nPausing at night under the orchard trees,\nWondered and crossed himself in holy doubt,\nFor through their song and in the murmuring breeze\nIt seemed angelic choirs were all about\nMingling in universal harmonies,\nAs though, responsive to the chords they woke,\nAll Nature into sweet epithalamium broke.\n\nAnd still they think a spirit haunts the place:\n'Tis said, when Night has drawn her jewelled pall\nAnd through the branches twinkling fireflies trace\nTheir mimic constellations, if it fall\nThat one should see the moon rise through the lace\nOf blossomy boughs above the garden wall,\nThat surely would he take great ill thereof\nAnd famish in a fit of unexpressive love.\n\nBut this I know not, for what time the wain\nWas loosened and the lily's petal furled,\nThen I would rise, climb the old wall again,\nAnd pausing look forth on the sundown world,\nScan the wide reaches of the wondrous plain,\nThe hamlet sites where settling smoke lay curled,\nThe poplar-bordered roads, and far away\nFair snowpeaks colored with the sun's last ray.\n\nWaves of faint sound would pulsate from afar\nFaint song and preludes of the summer night;\nDeep in the cloudless west the evening star\nHung 'twixt the orange and the emerald light;\nFrom the dark vale where shades crepuscular\nDimmed the old grove-girt belfry glimmering white,\nThrobbing, as gentlest breezes rose or fell,\nCame the sweet invocation of the evening bell."}

{"title":"The Jacquerie A Fragment","content":"Chapter I.\n\nOnce on a time, a Dawn, all red and bright\nLeapt on the conquered ramparts of the Night,\nAnd flamed, one brilliant instant, on the world,\nThen back into the historic moat was hurled\nAnd Night was King again, for many years.\n-- Once on a time the Rose of Spring blushed out\nBut Winter angrily withdrew it back\nInto his rough new-bursten husk, and shut\nThe stern husk-leaves, and hid it many years.\n-- Once Famine tricked himself with ears of corn,\nAnd Hate strung flowers on his spiked belt,\nAnd glum Revenge in silver lilies pranked him,\nAnd Lust put violets on his shameless front,\nAnd all minced forth o' the street like holiday folk\nThat sally off afield on Summer morns.\n-- Once certain hounds that knew of many a chase,\nAnd bare great wounds of antler and of tusk\nThat they had ta'en to give a lord some sport,\n-- Good hounds, that would have died to give lords sport --\nWere so bewrayed and kicked by these same lords\nThat all the pack turned tooth o' the knights and bit\nAs knights had been no better things than boars,\nAnd took revenge as bloody as a man's,\nUnhoundlike, sudden, hot i' the chops, and sweet.\n-- Once sat a falcon on a lady's wrist,\nSeeming to doze, with wrinkled eye-lid drawn,\nBut dreaming hard of hoods and slaveries\nAnd of dim hungers in his heart and wings.\nThen, while the mistress gazed above for game,\nSudden he flew into her painted face\nAnd hooked his horn-claws in her lily throat\nAnd drove his beak into her lips and eyes\nIn fierce and hawkish kissing that did scar\nAnd mar the lady's beauty evermore.\n-- And once while Chivalry stood tall and lithe\nAnd flashed his sword above the stricken eyes\nOf all the simple peasant-folk of France:\nWhile Thought was keen and hot and quick,\nAnd did not play, as in these later days,\nLike summer-lightning flickering in the west\n-- As little dreadful as if glow-worms lay\nIn the cool and watery clouds and glimmered weak --\nBut gleamed and struck at once or oak or man,\nAnd left not space for Time to wave his wing\nBetwixt the instantaneous flash and stroke:\nWhile yet the needs of life were brave and fierce\nAnd did not hide their deeds behind their words,\nAnd logic came not 'twixt desire and act,\nAnd Want-and-Take was the whole Form of life:\nWhile Love had fires a-burning in his veins,\nAnd hidden Hate could flash into revenge:\nEre yet young Trade was 'ware of his big thews\nOr dreamed that in the bolder afterdays\nHe would hew down and bind old Chivalry\nAnd drag him to the highest height of fame\nAnd plunge him thence in the sea of still Romance\nTo lie for aye in never-rusted mail\nGleaming through quiet ripples of soft songs\nAnd sheens of old traditionary tales; --\nOn such a time, a certain May arose\nFrom out that blue Sea that between five lands\nLies like a violet midst of five large leaves,\nArose from out this violet and flew on\nAnd stirred the spirits of the woods of France\nAnd smoothed the brows of moody Auvergne hills,\nAnd wrought warm sea-tints into maidens' eyes,\nAnd calmed the wordy air of market-towns\nWith faint suggestions blown from distant buds,\nUntil the land seemed a mere dream of land,\nAnd, in this dream-field Life sat like a dove\nAnd cooed across unto her dove-mate Death,\nBrooding, pathetic, by a river, lone.\nOh, sharper tangs pierced through this perfumed May.\nStrange aches sailed by with odors on the wind\nAs when we kneel in flowers that grow on graves\nOf friends who died unworthy of our love.\nKing John of France was proving such an ache\nIn English prisons wide and fair and grand,\nWhose long expanses of green park and chace\nDid ape large liberty with such success\nAs smiles of irony ape smiles of love.\nDown from the oaks of Hertford Castle park,\nDouble with warm rose-breaths of southern Spring\nCame rumors, as if odors too had thorns,\nSharp rumors, how the three Estates of France,\nLike old Three-headed Cerberus of Hell\nHad set upon the Duke of Normandy,\nTheir rightful Regent, snarled in his great face,\nSnapped jagged teeth in inch-breadth of his throat,\nAnd blown such hot and savage breath upon him,\nThat he had tossed great sops of royalty\nUnto the clamorous, three-mawed baying beast.\nAnd was not further on his way withal,\nAnd had but changed a snarl into a growl:\nHow Arnold de Cervolles had ta'en the track\nThat war had burned along the unhappy land,\nShouting, `since France is then too poor to pay\nThe soldiers that have bloody devoir done,\nAnd since needs must, pardie! a man must eat,\nArm, gentlemen! swords slice as well as knives!'\nAnd so had tempted stout men from the ranks,\nAnd now was adding robbers' waste to war's,\nStealing the leavings of remorseless battle,\nAnd making gaunter the gaunt bones of want:\nHow this Cervolles (called \"Arch-priest\" by the mass)\nThrough warm Provence had marched and menace made\nAgainst Pope Innocent at Avignon,\nAnd how the Pope nor ate nor drank nor slept,\nThrough godly fear concerning his red wines.\nFor if these knaves should sack his holy house\nAnd all the blessed casks be knocked o' the head,\nHORRENDUM! all his Holiness' drink to be\nProfanely guzzled down the reeking throats\nOf scoundrels, and inflame them on to seize\nThe massy coffers of the Church's gold,\nAnd steal, mayhap, the carven silver shrine\nAnd all the golden crucifixes? No! --\nAnd so the holy father Pope made stir\nAnd had sent forth a legate to Cervolles,\nAnd treated with him, and made compromise,\nAnd, last, had bidden all the Arch-priest's troop\nTo come and banquet with him in his house,\nWhere they did wassail high by night and day\nAnd Father Pope sat at the board and carved\nMidst jokes that flowed full greasily,\nAnd priest and soldier trolled good songs for mass,\nAnd all the prayers the Priests made were, `pray, drink,'\nAnd all the oaths the Soldiers swore were, `drink!'\nTill Mirth sat like a jaunty postillon\nUpon the back of Time and urged him on\nWith piquant spur, past chapel and past cross:\nHow Charles, King of Navarre, in long duress\nBy mandate of King John within the walls\nOf Crevacoeur and then of strong Alleres,\nIn faithful ward of Sir Tristan du Bois,\nWas now escaped, had supped with Guy Kyrec,\nHad now a pardon of the Regent Duke\nBy half compulsion of a Paris mob,\nHad turned the people's love upon himself\nBy smooth harangues, and now was bold to claim\nThat France was not the Kingdom of King John,\nBut, By our Lady, his, by right and worth,\nAnd so was plotting treason in the State,\nAnd laughing at weak Charles of Normandy.\nNay, these had been like good news to the King,\nWere any man but bold enough to tell\nThe King what [bitter] sayings men had made\nAnd hawked augmenting up and down the land\nAgainst the barons and great lords of France\nThat fled from English arrows at Poictiers.\nPOICTIERS, POICTIERS: this grain i' the eye of France\nHad swelled it to a big and bloodshot ball\nThat looked with rage upon a world askew.\nPoictiers' disgrace was now but two years old,\nYet so outrageous rank and full was grown\nThat France was wholly overspread with shade,\nAnd bitter fruits lay on the untilled ground\nThat stank and bred so foul contagious smells\nThat not a nose in France but stood awry,\nNor boor that cried not FAUGH! upon the air.\n\n\nChapter II.\n\nFranciscan friar John de Rochetaillade\nWith gentle gesture lifted up his hand\nAnd poised it high above the steady eyes\nOf a great crowd that thronged the market-place\nIn fair Clermont to hear him prophesy.\nMidst of the crowd old Gris Grillon, the maimed,\n-- A wretched wreck that fate had floated out\nFrom the drear storm of battle at Poictiers.\nA living man whose larger moiety\nWas dead and buried on the battle-field --\nA grisly trunk, without or arms or legs,\nAnd scarred with hoof-cuts over cheek and brow,\nLay in his wicker-cradle, smiling.\n\"Jacques,\"\nQuoth he, \"My son, I would behold this priest\nThat is not fat, and loves not wine, and fasts,\nAnd stills the folk with waving of his hand,\nAnd threats the knights and thunders at the Pope.\nMake way for Gris, ye who are whole of limb!\nSet me on yonder ledge, that I may see.\"\nForthwith a dozen horny hands reached out\nAnd lifted Gris Grillon upon the ledge,\nWhereon he lay and overlooked the crowd,\nAnd from the gray-grown hedges of his brows\nShot forth a glance against the friar's eye\nThat struck him like an arrow.\nThen the friar,\nWith voice as low as if a maiden hummed\nLove-songs of Provence in a mild day-dream:\n\"And when he broke the second seal, I heard\nThe second beast say, Come and see.\nAnd then\nWent out another horse, and he was red.\nAnd unto him that sat thereon was given\nTo take the peace of earth away, and set\nMen killing one another: and they gave\nTo him a mighty sword.\"\nThe friar paused\nAnd pointed round the circle of sad eyes.\n\"There is no face of man or woman here\nBut showeth print of the hard hoof of war.\nAh, yonder leaneth limbless Gris Grillon.\nFriends, Gris Grillon is France.\nGood France; my France,\nWilt never walk on glory's hills again?\nWilt never work among thy vines again?\nArt footless and art handless evermore?\n-- Thou felon, War, I do arraign thee now\nOf mayhem of the four main limbs of France!\nThou old red criminal, stand forth; I charge\n-- But O, I am too utter sorrowful\nTo urge large accusation now.\nNathless,\nMy work to-day, is still more grievous.

vision of forgetfulness.\nO Dream\nBorn of a dream, as yonder cloud is born\nOf water which is born of cloud!\nI thought\nI saw the moonlight lying large and calm\nUpon the unthrobbing bosom of the earth,\nAs a great diamond glittering on a shroud.\nA sense of breathlessness stilled all the world.\nMotion stood dreaming he was changed to Rest,\nAnd Life asleep did fancy he was Death.\nA quick small shadow spotted the white world;\nThen instantly 'twas huge, and huger grew\nBy instants till it did o'ergloom all space.\nI lifted up mine eyes -- O thou just God!\nI saw a spectre with a million heads\nCome frantic downward through the universe,\nAnd all the mouths of it were uttering cries,\nWherein was a sharp agony, and yet\nThe cries were much like laughs: as if Pain laughed.\nIts myriad lips were blue, and sometimes they\nClosed fast and only moaned dim sounds that shaped\nThemselves to one word, `Homeless', and the stars\nDid utter back the moan, and the great hills\nDid bellow it, and then the stars and hills\nBandied the grief o' the ghost 'twixt heaven and earth.\nThe spectre sank, and lay upon the air,\nAnd brooded, level, close upon the earth,\nWith all the myriad heads just over me.\nI glanced in all the eyes and marked that some\nDid glitter with a flame of lunacy,\nAnd some were soft and false as feigning love,\nAnd some were blinking with hypocrisy,\nAnd some were overfilmed by sense, and some\nBlazed with ambition's wild, unsteady fire,\nAnd some were burnt i' the sockets black, and some\nWere dead as embers when the fire is out.\nA curious zone circled the Spectre's waist,\nWhich seemed with strange device to symbol Time.\nIt was a silver-gleaming thread of day\nSpiral about a jet-black band of night.\nThis zone seemed ever to contract and all\nThe frame with momentary spasms heaved\nIn the strangling traction which did never cease.\nI cried unto the spectre, `Time hath bound\nThy body with the fibre of his hours.'\nThen rose a multitude of mocking sounds,\nAnd some mouths spat at me and cried `thou fool',\nAnd some, `thou liest', and some, `he dreams': and then\nSome hands uplifted certain bowls they bore\nTo lips

and huntsmen and a noisy train\nOf loyal-stomached flatterers and their squires\nClattered in retinue, and aped his pace,\nAnd timed their talk by his, and worked their eyes\nBy intimation of his glance, with great\nAnd drilled precision.\nThen said the fool:\n\"'Twas a brave flight, my lord, that last one! brave.\nDidst note the heron once did turn about,\nAnd show a certain anger with his
